# OVERVIEW
#
#   Temporary Directory Discovery
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   We call this script once per build to ideally find a folder that's
#   backed by an in-memory file system. We then export it to the TMPDIR
#   environment variable. Many programs use it under the hood, e.g. gcc,
#   so it grants many small performance improvements.

mkdir -p o/tmp
echo o/tmp
