ERROR

  APE Execution error.

DETAILS

  Your system has probably been configured to use binfmt_misc. You need
  to run the command below to install /usr/bin/ape and register it with
  binfmt_misc. See ape/loader.c for source code, and technical details.

WORKAROUND

  ape/apeinstall.sh

NOTES

  If it still doesn't work, possibly due to an overly aggressive WINE
  or WSL registration, or possibly due to the ordering of definitions,
  then one troubleshooting step is to just unregister everything using
  sudo sh -c 'echo -1 >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/status' and try again.
