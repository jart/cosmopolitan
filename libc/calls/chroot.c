/**
 * Changes root directory.
 *
 * Please consider using unveil() instead of chroot(). If you use this
 * system call then consider using both chdir() and closefrom() before
 * calling this function. Otherwise there's a small risk that fchdir()
 * could be used to escape the chroot() environment. Cosmopolitan Libc
 * focuses on static binaries which make chroot() infinitely easier to
 * use since you don't need to construct an entire userspace each time
 * however unveil() is still better to use on modern Linux and OpenBSD
 * because it doesn't require root privileges.
 *
 * @param path shall become the new root directory
 * @return 0 on success, or -1 w/ errno
 * @raise EACCES if we don't have permission to search a component of `path`
 * @raise ENOTDIR if a directory component in `path` exists as non-directory
 * @raise ENAMETOOLONG if symlink-resolved `path` length exceeds `PATH_MAX`
 * @raise ENAMETOOLONG if component in `path` exists longer than `NAME_MAX`
 * @raise EPERM if not root or pledge() is in play
 * @raise EIO if a low-level i/o error occurred
 * @raise EFAULT if `path` is bad memory
 * @raise ENOENT if `path` doesn't exist
 * @raise ENOSYS on Windows
