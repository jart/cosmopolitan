/**
 * Duplicates file descriptor.
 *
 * The `O_CLOEXEC` flag shall be cleared from the resulting file
 * descriptor; see dup3() to preserve it.
 *
 * One use case for duplicating file descriptors is to be able to
 * reassign an open()'d file or pipe() to the stdio of an executed
 * subprocess. On Windows, in order for this to work, the subprocess
 * needs to be a Cosmopolitan program that has socket() linked.
 *
 * Only small programs should duplicate sockets. That's because this
 * implementation uses DuplicateHandle() on Windows, which Microsoft
 * says might cause its resources to leak internally. Thus it likely
 * isn't a good idea to design a server that does it a lot and lives
 * a long time, without contributing a patch to this implementation.
 *
 * @param fd remains open afterwards
 * @return some arbitrary new number for fd
 * @raise EPERM if pledge() is in play without stdio
 * @raise ENOTSUP if `fd` is a zip file descriptor
 * @raise EBADF if `fd` is negative or not open
 * @asyncsignalsafe
 * @vforksafe
