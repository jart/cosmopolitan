/**
 * Duplicates file descriptor, granting it specific number.
 *
 * Unlike dup3(), the dup2() function permits oldfd and newfd to be the
 * same, in which case the only thing this function does is test if
 * oldfd is open.
 *
 * The `O_CLOEXEC` flag shall be cleared from the resulting file
 * descriptor; see dup3() to preserve it.
 *
 * One use case for duplicating file descriptors is to be able to
 * reassign an open()'d file or pipe() to the stdio of an executed
 * subprocess. On Windows, in order for this to work, the subprocess
 * needs to be a Cosmopolitan program that has socket() linked.
 *
 * Only small programs should duplicate sockets. That's because this
 * implementation uses DuplicateHandle() on Windows, which Microsoft
 * says might cause its resources to leak internally. Thus it likely
 * isn't a good idea to design a server that does it a lot and lives
 * a long time, without contributing a patch to this implementation.
 *
 * @param oldfd isn't closed afterwards
 * @param newfd if already assigned, is silently closed beforehand;
 *     unless it's equal to oldfd, in which case dup2() is a no-op
 * @return new file descriptor, or -1 w/ errno
 * @raise EPERM if pledge() is in play without stdio
 * @raise EMFILE if `RLIMIT_NOFILE` has been reached
 * @raise ENOTSUP if `oldfd` is on zip file system
 * @raise EINTR if a signal handler was called
 * @raise EBADF is `newfd` negative or too big
 * @raise EBADF is `oldfd` isn't open
 * @asyncsignalsafe
 * @vforksafe
