/**
 * Sets resource limit for current process.
 *
 * The following resources are recommended:
 *
 * - `RLIMIT_STACK` controls how much stack memory is available to the
 *   main thread. This setting is inherited across fork() and execve()
 *   Please note it's only safe for Cosmopolitan programs, to set this
 *   value to at least `PTHREAD_STACK_MIN * 2`. On Windows this cannot
 *   be used to extend the stack, which is currently hard-coded.
 *
 * - `RLIMIT_AS` limits the size of the virtual address space. This will
 *   work on all platforms except WSL. It is emulated on XNU and Windows
 *   which means it won't propagate across execve() currently.
 *
 * - `RLIMIT_CPU` causes `SIGXCPU` to be sent to the process when the
 *   soft limit on CPU time is exceeded, and the process is destroyed
 *   when the hard limit is exceeded. It works everywhere but Windows
 *   where it should be possible to poll getrusage() with setitimer()
 *
 * - `RLIMIT_FSIZE` causes `SIGXFSZ` to sent to the process when the
 *   soft limit on file size is exceeded and the process is destroyed
 *   when the hard limit is exceeded. It works everywhere but Windows
 *   and it also causes `EFBIG` to be returned by i/o functions after
 *   the `SIGXFSZ` signal is delivered or ignored
 *
 * - `RLIMIT_NPROC` limits the number of simultaneous processes and it
 *   should work on all platforms except Windows. Please be advised it
 *   limits the process, with respect to the activities of the user id
 *   as a whole.
 *
 * - `RLIMIT_NOFILE` limits the number of open file descriptors and it
 *   should work on all platforms except Windows (TODO)
 *
 * The rlimit magnums differ for each platform but occupy the interval
 * zero through `RLIM_NLIMITS`. Usually they're set to `RLIM_INFINITY`
 * which is `-1` on Linux/Windows, and `LONG_MAX` on BSDs. In any case
 * they're both very large numbers under the Cosmopolitan unsigned ABI
 * because struct rlimit uses uint64_t. The special magnum 127 is used
 * for constant values that aren't supported by the host platform.
 *
 * @param rlim specifies new resource limit
 * @return 0 on success or -1 w/ errno
 * @see libc/sysv/consts.sh
 * @vforksafe
