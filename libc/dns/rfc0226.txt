                   STANDARDIZATION OF HOST MNEUMONICS

IN EACH TELNET IMPLEMENTATION, A LIST OF HOST NMEUMONICS IS PROVIDED
FOR THE USER TO INDICATE THE SERVING HOST DESIRED.  CURRENTLY, EACH
SITE EMPLOYS THEIR OWN SPECIAL LIST.  RATHER THAN REQUIRE THE USER TO
BE COGNIZANT OF THE IDIOSYNCRASIES OF EACH LIST, ESPECIALLY WHEN
CHAINED THROUGH SEVERAL HOSTS VIA TELNET, IT HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED THAT
STANDARD HOST DESIGNATORS BE ADOPTED.

THE FOLLOWING LIST OF SIX CHARACTER DESIGNATORS IS PROPOSED AS THE
STANDARD LIST.  REGISTER ANY OBJECTIONS BY 3 OCTOBER TO P. KARP (703)
893-3500 X2391, X2318. AN OFFICIAL POLICY AND IMPLEMENTATION DATE WILL
BE SET ON 8 OCTOBER.

THE LIST:
