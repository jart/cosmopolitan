/**
 * Allocates uninitialized memory.
 *
 * Returns a pointer to a newly allocated chunk of at least n bytes, or
 * null if no space is available, in which case errno is set to ENOMEM
 * on ANSI C systems.
 *
 * If n is zero, malloc returns a minimum-sized chunk. (The minimum size
 * is 32 bytes on 64bit systems.) It should be assumed that zero bytes
 * are possible access, since that'll be enforced by `MODE=asan`.
 *
 * Note that size_t is an unsigned type, so calls with arguments that
 * would be negative if signed are interpreted as requests for huge
 * amounts of space, which will often fail. The maximum supported value
 * of n differs across systems, but is in all cases less than the
 * maximum representable value of a size_t.
 *
 * @param rdi is number of bytes needed, coerced to 1+
 * @return new memory, or NULL w/ errno
