 * other allocated objects. This is not a particularly great
 * programming practice. malloc_usable_size can be more useful in
 * debugging and assertions, for example:
 *
 *     p = malloc(n)
 *     assert(malloc_usable_size(p) >= 256)
 *
 * @param p is address of allocation
 * @return total number of bytes
 * @see dlmalloc_usable_size()
