/**
 * Allocates / resizes / frees memory, e.g.
 *
 * Returns a pointer to a chunk of size n that contains the same data as
 * does chunk p up to the minimum of (n, p's size) bytes, or null if no
 * space is available.
 *
 * If p is NULL, then realloc() is equivalent to malloc().
 *
 * If p is not NULL and n is 0, then realloc() shrinks the allocation to
 * zero bytes. The allocation isn't freed and still continues to be a
 * uniquely allocated piece of memory. However it should be assumed that
 * zero bytes can be accessed, since that's enforced by `MODE=asan`.
 *
 * The returned pointer may or may not be the same as p. The algorithm
 * prefers extending p in most cases when possible, otherwise it employs
 * the equivalent of a malloc-copy-free sequence.
 *
 * Please note that p is NOT free()'d should realloc() fail, thus:
 *
 *     if ((p2 = realloc(p, n2))) {
 *       p = p2;
 *       ...
 *     } else {
 *       ...
 *     }
 *
 * if n is for fewer bytes than already held by p, the newly unused
 * space is lopped off and freed if possible.
 *
 * The old unix realloc convention of allowing the last-free'd chunk to
 * be used as an argument to realloc is not supported.
 *
 * @param p is address of current allocation or NULL
 * @param n is number of bytes needed
 * @return rax is result, or NULL w/ errno w/o free(p)
 * @see dlrealloc()
