/**
 * Terminates current POSIX thread.
 *
 * For example, a thread could terminate early as follows:
 *
 *     pthread_exit((void *)123);
 *
 * The result value could then be obtained when joining the thread:
 *
 *     void *rc;
 *     pthread_join(id, &rc);
 *     assert((intptr_t)rc == 123);
 *
 * Under normal circumstances a thread can exit by simply returning from
 * the callback function that was supplied to pthread_create(). This may
 * be used if the thread wishes to exit at any other point in the thread
 * lifecycle, in which case this function is responsible for ensuring we
 * invoke gc(), _defer(), and pthread_cleanup_push() callbacks, and also
 * pthread_key_create() destructors.
 *
 * If the current thread is an orphaned thread, or is the main thread
 * when no other threads were created, then this will terminated your
 * process with an exit code of zero. It's not possible to supply a
 * non-zero exit status to wait4() via this function.
 *
 * Once a thread has exited, access to its stack memory is undefined.
 * The behavior of calling pthread_exit() from cleanup handlers and key
 * destructors is also undefined.
 *
 * @param rc is reported later to pthread_join()
 * @noreturn
