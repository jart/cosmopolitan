/**
 * Gets thread attributes.
 *
 * These attributes are copied from the ones supplied when
 * pthread_create() was called. However this function supplies
 * additional runtime information too:
 *
 * 1. The detached state. You can use pthread_attr_getdetachstate() on
 *    the `attr` result to see, for example, if a thread detached itself
 *    or some other thread detached it, after it was spawned.
 *
 * 2. The thread's stack. You can use pthread_attr_getstack() to see the
 *    address and size of the stack that was allocated by cosmo for your
 *    thread. This is useful for knowing where the stack is. It can also
 *    be useful If you explicitly configured a stack too, since we might
 *    have needed to slightly tune the address and size to meet platform
 *    requirements.
 *
 * 3. You can view changes pthread_create() may have made to the stack
 *    guard size by calling pthread_attr_getguardsize() on `attr`
 *
 * @param attr is output argument that receives attributes, which should
 *     find its way to pthread_attr_destroy() when it's done being used
 * @return 0 on success, or errno on error
 * @raise ENOMEM is listed as a possible result by LSB 5.0
