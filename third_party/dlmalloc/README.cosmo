LOCAL CHANGES

  - Fix MT-safety bugs in DEBUG mode that Intel discovered

  - Fix bug in dlmalloc_inspect_all(). It basically didn't work before
    when you use mspaces with mmap(). Now we can have a leak detector.

  - Remove the normal allocation code. We only want mspaces. Not brk!

  - Introduce threaded.inc and rseq.inc which make dlmalloc scalable on
    multiprocessor systems.

  - Remove "independent malloc" and "bulk free". They probably existed
    as a way to avoid lock contention. Since we have a better solution
    we don't need these non-standard APIs that aren't very good.

  - Use faster two power roundup for memalign()

  - Use ckd_mul() for faster realloc multiplication

  - Implement malloc locks using nsync. In MODE=tiny we use spin locks.
