DESCRIPTION

  HACL* is a high-assurance cryptographic library. The code for these
  algorithms is formally verified using the F* verification framework
  for memory safety, functional correctness, and secret independence
  (resistance to some types of timing side-channels).

DOCUMENTATION

  Public APIs are defined in haclstar.h

  Ed25519 can be used for digital signing and verification.

  HPKE can be used to add TLS v1.3 quality security to your TCP and UDP
  berkeley sockets. You use HPKE to perform a zero roundtrip handshake,
  and then use Chacha20Poly1305 to perform symmetric encryption of data.
  The performance you should expect is about twenty gigabits/s per core.
  Curve25519, HKDF, and HMAC are used by HPKE as implementation details.

  BLAKE2B is the strongest fastest hashing function. By default it has a
  512 bit (or 64 byte) digest length, which offers 256 bits of collision
  resistance, but you can tune the output size to be anything smaller.
  Performance has been measured at 1500 mbyte/sec on Threadripper PRO.

  SHA1 and SHA2 are also provided for hashing. However they go slower
  (about 500 mbyte/sec) and are less timing resistant since we don't
  have hardware acceleration implemented for the SHA subroutines. The
  exception is SHA2-256 and SHA2-224 on x86 which goes 2300 mbyte/sec.

LOCAL MODIFICATIONS

  - Remove unused int128 params from curve25519 helpers. It allows us to
    link these functions externally without making ed25519 33% slower

  - Pull sha256_update() and sha512_update() out into their own modules
    and make they're compiled at -Os (adds at least 33% performance) and
    that ubsan isn't used (since it makes them take minutes to compile)

  - Simplify Hacl_Impl_HPKE_context_s to not store all those pointers.

  - Use `cc -E -fdirective-only` on hacl/dist/ to escape header hell

  - Reduce stack consumption in ed25519

  - Use cosmopolitan endianness macros

  - Write documentation for Frodo

  - Map throwaway stack for Frodo

  - Add const keywords

  - Ran clang-format
