   This is the Info-ZIP file ``WHERE,'' last updated on 1 March 2005.
__________________________________________________________________________

   This file is out of date.  We plan to update the structure of the ftp
   site shortly and should be updating this file as soon as that's done.

   The latest version of this file can be found online at:

           ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/doc/WHERE

   Note that some ftp sites may not yet have the latest versions of Zip
   and UnZip when you read this.  The latest versions always appear in
   ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/ (and subdirectories thereof) first,
   except for encryption binaries, which always appear in
   ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/infozip/ (and subdirectories) first.

   IF YOU FIND AN ERROR:  please let us know!  We don't have time to
   check each and every site personally (or even collectively), so any
   number of the sites listed below may have moved or disappeared en-
   tirely.  E-mail to Zip-Bugs@lists.wku.edu and we'll update this file.

Info-ZIP's home WWW site is listed on Yahoo and is at:

   ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/Info-ZIP.html  (master version)
   http://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/              (master version)
   http://www.info-zip.org/

Note that the old sites at http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/ and
http://www.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip are PERMANENTLY BROKEN.  They
cannot be updated or removed, apparently.

The Zip and UnZip pages have links to most known mirror sites carrying our
source and/or binary distributions, and they generally are more up-to-date
and have better information than what you are reading:

   ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/Zip.html
   ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/UnZip.html

The related zlib package by Info-ZIP's Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler is at:

Source-code archives for Info-ZIP's portable Zip, UnZip, and related
utilities:

   zip231.zip        Zip 2.31 (deflation; includes zipnote/zipsplit/zipcloak)
   zip231.tar.Z      ditto, compress'd tar format

   zip11.zip         Zip 1.1 (shrinking, implosion; compatible w. PKUNZIP 1.1)
   zip11.tar.Z       ditto, compress'd tar format

   unzip552.zip      UnZip 5.52 (all methods[*]; unzip/funzip/unzipsfx/zipgrep)
   unzip552.tar.gz   ditto, gzip'd tar format
   unzip552.tar.Z    ditto, compress'd tar format

   unred552.zip      UnZip 5.52 add-on, contains copyrighted unreduce support

   zcrypt29.zip      encryption support for Zip 2.3[**]
   zcrypt10.zip      encryption support for Zip 1.1

   MacZip106src.zip  contains all the GUI stuff and the project files to build
                     the MacZip main-app.  To build MacZip successfully, both
                     the Zip 2.31 and UnZip 5.52 sources are required, too.

   wiz502.zip        WiZ 5.02, Windows 9x/NT GUI front-end for Info-ZIP DLLs
   wiz502+dlls.zip   WiZ 5.02, Windows 9x/NT GUI front-end plus DLL sources

[*] Unreducing is disabled by default, but is available as add-on.
    As of July 2004, Unisys's LZW patent was expired worldwide, and
    unshrinking is turned on by default since the release of UnZip 5.52.
    See UnZip's INSTALL file for details.

[**] As of January 2000, US export regulations were amended to allow export
     of free encryption source code from the US.  As of June 2002, these
     regulations were further relaxed to allow export of encryption binaries
     associated with free encryption source code.  The Zip 2.31, UnZip 5.52
     and Wiz 5.02 archives now include full crypto source code.  As of the
     Zip 2.31 release, all official binaries include encryption support; the
     former "zcr" archives ceased to exist.
     (Note that restrictions may still exist in other countries, of course.)

ftp/web sites for the US-exportable sources and executables:

   NOTE:  Look for the Info-ZIP file names given above (not PKWARE or third-
   party stuff) in the following locations.  Some sites like to use slightly
   different names, such as zip-2.31.tar.gz instead of zip231.tar.Z.

ftp/web sites for the encryption and decryption sources and/or executables:

   Outside the US:
      ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/   [THE INFO-ZIP HOME SITE]
      ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/infozip/        [THE INFO-ZIP ENCRYPTION HOME SITE]

The primary distribution site for the MacZip port can be found at:

   http://www.sitec.net/maczip/

ftp sites for VMS-format Zip and UnZip packages (sources, object files and
executables, no encryption/decryption--see also "Mail servers" section below):

   ftp.spc.edu [192.107.46.27] and ftp.wku.edu:

   [.MACRO32]AAAREADME.TXT
   [.MACRO32.SAVESETS]UNZIP.BCK  or  UNZIP.ZIP  (if already have older version)
   [.MACRO32.SAVESETS]ZIP.ZIP

To find other ftp/web sites:

   The "archie" ftp database utility can be used to find an ftp site near
   you (although the command-line versions always seem to find old ver-
   sions...the `FTPsearch' server at http://ftpsearch.ntnu.no/ftpsearch
   --formerly `Archie 95'--is quite up-to-date, however).  Or check a stan-
   dard WWW search engine like AltaVista (http://www.altavista.digital.com/)
   or Yahoo (http://www.yahoo.com/).  If you don't know how to use these,
   DON'T ASK US--read the web sites' help pages or check the Usenet groups
   news.announce.newusers or news.answers or some such, or ask your system
   administrator.

Mail servers:

   To get the encryption sources by e-mail, send the following commands
   to ftp-mailer@informatik.tu-muenchen.de:

      get /pub/comp/os/os2/archiver/zcrypt29.zip
      quit

   To get the VMS Zip/UnZip package by e-mail, send the following
   commands in the body of a mail message to fileserv@wku.edu (the
   "HELP" command is also accepted):

      SEND FILESERV_TOOLS
      SEND UNZIP
      SEND ZIP

   To get Atari executables by e-mail, send a message to
   atari@atari.archive.umich.edu for information about the mail server.
