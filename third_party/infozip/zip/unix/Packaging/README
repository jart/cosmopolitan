Solaris packaging
-----------------

To generate a Solaris package for Info-ZIP zip utilities,
first see the top level INSTALL and README files.  Do a
"make solaris", which will automatically build two Solaris
installable package files for the package, IZzip.

   IZzip     -- Solaris installable package in directory format.
   IZzip_$(arch).pkg -- Solaris installable package in "stream" format.

   Where:  $(arch) := system architecture, currently i386, sparc, or ppc.
                      (use "uname -p" to determine)

The ".pkg" file is a single file datastream that can be compressed
and/or ftp'd.  This is the recommended form, because all required
files are resident in the archive, and it is easily distributed.

To install, simply:

    1)  copy the package to the target system's /tmp directory.
    2)  login or su to root
    3)  pkgadd -d /tmp/IZzip_$(arch).pkg
    4)  add /opt/Info-ZIP/IZzip/bin to PATH
    5)  add /opt/Info-ZIP/IZzip/man to MANPATH

This works for both SPARC and x86.

Ongoing maintenance:

  Keep the files, "prototype" and "pkginfo.in" up to date.
  Observe variable substitutions made by "Makefile".
  See manpages for pkginfo(1), pkginfo(4), pkgmk(1), pkgproto(1)

Variations:

  If you wish the base directory to be set to something other than
  /opt/Info-ZIP, change the setting BASEDIR in pkginfo.in and
  re-run the make.
