ZIP

Zip is a compression and file packaging utility for several operating
systems, including UNIX, VMS,  MSDOS, OS/2, Windows 9x/NT/XP, Minix,
Atari, Macintosh, Amiga, and Acorn RISC OS.  It is analogous to a
combination of tar and compress and is compatible with PKZIP (Phil
Katz's ZIP) for MSDOS systems.

Zip is useful for packaging a set of files for distribution, for
archiving files, and for saving disk space by temporarily compressing
unused files or directories.  A companion program, UnZip, unpacks Zip
archives.

For brief help on Zip or UnZip, run the program without specifying any
parameters on the command line.

This description covers the Zip program which uses a VMS-style CLI
command line.  The VMS CLI Zip program also accepts UNIX-style "-opt"
options, but a separate Zip program is available which provides only a
UNIX-style  command line, and it has its own documentation.  Refer to
the Zip installation instructions for details.

<TOPIC>
Basic_Usage

<FORMAT>
ZIP [/options] archive inpath, inpath ...

The default action of Zip is to add or replace entries in "archive" from
the list of "inpath" file specifications, which can include directories
and file names with VMS-style wildcards.  If /BATCH is specified, Zip
will read file specifications from a list file or from SYS$INPUT
(stdin).

With SET PROCESS /PARSE_STYLE = EXTENDED (available on recent non-VAX
systems), Zip preserves the case of the command line.  Otherwise, mixed-
or upper-case arguments (file names) must be quoted.  Examples in this
document generally do not show this quotation, so VAX and /PARSE_STYLE =
TRADITIONAL users (that is, troglodytes) will need to add quotation
where needed when working with these examples.

General

Zip reads one or more files, compresses the data (normally), and stores
the compressed information into a single Zip archive file, along with
information about each file (name, path, date and time of last
modification, protection, and check information to verify file
integrity).  On a VMS system, Zip can also save VMS/RMS file attributes,
allowing UnZip to restore the files without loss of important file
attributes.  Zip can pack an entire directory structure into a Zip
archive with a single command.

Compression

Compression ratios of 2:1 to 3:1 are common for text files.  Zip has one
standard compression method ("deflate") and can also store files without
compression.  Zip (and UnZip) may be built with optional support for the
bzip2 compression method.  Then, the user may select bzip2 compression
instead of the default "deflate" method.  Zip automatically chooses
simple storage over compression for a file, if the specified compression
method does not actually compress the data in that file.

Compatibility

Zip and UnZip can work with archives produced by PKZIP (supporting most
PKZIP features up to PKZIP version 4.6), and PKZIP and PKUNZIP can work
with archives produced by Zip (with some exceptions, notably streamed
archives, but recent changes in the .ZIP file standard may facilitate
better compatibility).  Zip version 3.0 is compatible with PKZIP 2.04
and also supports the Zip64 extensions of PKZIP 4.5 which allows
archives as well as files to exceed the previous 2 GB limit (4 GB in
some cases).  Zip also supports bzip2 compression if the bzip2 library
is included when Zip is built.  Note that PKUNZIP 1.10 cannot extract
files produced by PKZIP 2.04 or Zip 3.0.  You must use PKUNZIP 2.04g or
UnZip 5.0p1 (or later versions) to extract them.

Large Archives and Zip64

Where the operating system and C run-time support allow, Zip 3.0 and
UnZip 6.0 (and later versions) support large files (input and archive),
using the Zip64 extensions to the original .ZIP file format.  On VMS,
this genarally means non-VAX systems with VMS V7.2 or later (perhaps
requiring a C RTL ECO before VMS V7.3-2).

Zip automatically uses the Zip64 extensions when a file 4 GB or larger
is added to an archive, an archive containing a Zip64 entry is updated
(if the resulting archive still needs Zip64), the size of the archive
will exceed 4 GB, or when the number of entries in the archive will
exceed about 64K.  Zip64 is also used for archives streamed to a
non-seekable output device.  You must use a 4.5 compatible UnZip to
extract files using the Zip64 extensions such as UnZip 6.0 or later.

In addition, streamed archives, entries encrypted with standard
encryption, or split archives created with the pause option may not be
compatible with PKZIP as data descriptors are used, and PKZIP at the
time of this writing does not support data descriptors (but recent
changes in the PKWare published .ZIP file standard now include some
support for the data descriptor format Zip uses).

<TOPIC>
More_Usage

Here is a very simple example of Zip use:

<LITERAL>
|  zip stuff.zip *.*
<LARETIL>

This will create the Zip archive "stuff.zip" (assuming it does not
already exist) and put all the (non-directory) files (";0") from the
current default directory into "stuff.zip" in a compressed form.  The
archive is opened using a default file specification of
"SYS$DISK:[].zip", so specifying "stuff" as the archive name would also
create (or use an existing) "stuff.zip", but specifying "stuff.other"
would give you that name.  In general, Zip doesn't care about the type
in the file specification, but for split archives (archives split over
multiple files), the user should normally specify a type-less name,
because Zip will normally generate sequentially numbered types ".z01",
".z02", and so on for the early splits, and then the required ".zip" for
the last split.  These file types are required by the Zip standard for
split archives.

Standard VMS wildcard expansion ($SEARCH) is used to interpret the
"inpath" file and directory specifications, like the "*.*" in this
example.

On VMS, the most natural way to archive an entire directory tree is to
use a directory-depth wildcard ("[...]").  For example:

<LITERAL>
|  zip foo [...]*.*
<LARETIL>

This will create the file "foo.zip" containing all the files (";0") and
directories in and below the current default directory.  A more
UNIX-like way to do this would be to use the /RECURSE option:

<LITERAL>
|  zip /recurse foo *.*
<LARETIL>

Zip avoids including its own output files when selecting files to
include in the archive, so it should be safe, as in this case, to create
the archive in the same drectory as the input files.

One or more specific files, directories, or subdirectories may also be
specified:

<LITERAL>
|  zip foo.zip readme.txt, [www...]*.*, [.ftp...]*.*, -
|   [.src]*.h, [.src]*.c
<LARETIL>

For security reasons, paths in Zip archives are always stored as
relative paths, so some care is needed when creating an archive so that
it will create the intended directory structure when UnZip is used to
unpack it.

To use /RECURSE with a specific directory, the name of the directory
file itself must be specified:

<LITERAL>
|  zip /recurse foo.zip [000000]www.dir, ftp.dir
<LARETIL>

You may want to make an archive that contains the files in [.foo], but
not record the directory name, "foo".  You can use the /JUNK (junk path)
option to leave off the path:

<LITERAL>
|  zip /junk foo [.foo]*.*
<LARETIL>

If you are short on disk space, you might not have enough room to hold
both the original directory and the corresponding compressed Zip
archive.  In this case, you can create the archive in steps, and use the
-m option.  For example, if [.foo] contains the subdirectories [.tom],
[.dick], and [.harry], you could:

<LITERAL>
|  zip /move foo [.foo.tom...]*.*
|  zip /move foo [.foo.dick...]*.*
|  zip /move foo [.foo.harry...]*.*
<LARETIL>

The first command would create foo.zip, and the next two would add to
it.  The /MOVE option will cause Zip to delete all files added to the
archive after making or updating foo.zip.  No deletions will be done
until the Zip operation has completed with no errors.  This option is
obviously dangerous and should be used with care, but it does reduce the
need for free disk space.  When /MOVE is used, the /TEST option is
recommended and will test the resulting archive before deleting the
input files.

If a file specification list is too long to fit conveniently on the Zip
command line, the /BATCH option can be used to cause Zip to read a list
of file specifications from a file or from SYS$INPUT (stdin).  If a DCL
command procedure is used, the names can be specified in the procedure:

<LITERAL>
|  $ zip foo /batch
|  $ deck
|  file_spec_1
|  file_spec_2
|  file_spec_3
|  $ eod
<LARETIL>

The file specifications can also be put into a separate file, and fed
into Zip by specifying that file as "/BATCH = list_file", or by
explicitly defining SYS$INPUT, or by using PIPE.  For example, with the
list in foo.zfl:
<LITERAL>
|  zip foo /batch = foo.zfl
<LARETIL>
or:
<LITERAL>
|  define /user_mode sys$input foo.zfl
|  zip foo /batch
<LARETIL>
or:
<LITERAL>
|  pipe type foo.zfl | zip foo /batch
<LARETIL>

If Zip is not able to read a file, it issues a warning but continues.
See the /MUST_MATCH option for more on how Zip handles patterns that are
not matched and files that are not readable.  If some files were
skipped, a warning is issued at the end of the Zip operation noting how
many files were read and how many skipped.
<TOPIC>
Environment

A user can specify default command-line options and arguments by
defining an "environment variable" (that is, a logical name or DCL
symbol), "ZIP_OPTS" or "ZIPOPT", to specify them.  If both "ZIP_OPTS"
and "ZIPOPT" are specified, the definition of "ZIPOPT" prevails.

UNIX-style command-line options are required in these variables, even
for the VMS CLI Zip program.  For details, see the help topic
UNIX_Options, or the separate Zip help for the UNIX-style command line.

The C RTL function getenv() is used to sense these variables, so its
behavior determines what happens if both a logical name and a symbol are
defined.  As of VMS V7.3, a logical name supercedes a symbol.

The "zip /VERBOSE" report should show the perceived settings of these
variables.

For example, the following will cause Zip to skip directories, include
VMS portable attribute information, and perform all operations at
quiet-level 1 by default:

<LITERAL>
|  $ define ZIP_OPTS "-qDV"
<LARETIL>

Note that the quotation marks here are required to preserve lowercase
options (opposite of the command-line behavior).

<TOPIC>
Exit_Status

On VMS, Zip's UNIX-style exit values are mapped into VMS-style status
codes with facility code 1955 = %x7A3, and with the inhibit-message
(%x10000000) and facility-specific (%x00008000) bits set:

<LITERAL>
|     %x17A38001                        normal exit
|     %x17A38000+ 16* Zip_error_code    warnings
|     %x17A38002+ 16* Zip_error_code    normal errors
|     %x17A38004+ 16* Zip_error_code    fatal errors
<LARETIL>

Note that multiplying the UNIX-style Zip error code by 16 places it
conveniently in the hexadecimal representation of the VMS exit code,
"__" in %x17A38__s, where "s" is the severity code.  For example, a
truncated archive might cause Zip error code 2, which would be
transformed into the VMS exit status %x17A38024.

The Zip VMS exit codes include severity values which approximate those
defined by PKWARE, as shown in the following table:

<LITERAL0>
|  VMS      Zip err
|severity    code     Error description
|---------+---------+----------------------------------------------
|Success       0      (OK) Normal; no errors or warnings detected.
|Fatal         2      (EOF) Unexpected end of archive.
|Error         3      (FORM) A generic error in the archive format
|                     was detected.  Processing may have completed
|                     successfully anyway;  some  broken  archives
|                     created by other archivers have simple work-
|                     arounds.

<TOPIC>
File_Names

Zip deals with file names in the system file system and with file names
in Zip archives.  File names in a Zip archive are stored in a UNIX-like
path-name format.  For example, a VMS file specification like this:

<LITERAL>
[.zip30.vms]descrip.mms
<LARETIL>

could appear in a Zip archive as:

<LITERAL>
zip30/vms/descrip.mms
<LARETIL>

For security reasons, paths in Zip archives are always stored as
relative paths, so an absolute VMS directory specification will be
transformed to a relative path in the archive (that is, no leading "/").
For example, the following absolute directory specification would give
the same archive path as the previous (relative) example:

<LITERAL>
[zip30.vms]descrip.mms
<LARETIL>

Also, device names are dropped, so the following file specification
would also give the same archive path:

<LITERAL>
sys$sysdevice:[zip30.vms]descrip.mms
<LARETIL>

If an archive is intended for use with PKUNZIP under MSDOS, then the
/PKZIP option should be used to attempt to adjust the names and paths to
conform to MSDOS character-set and length limitations, to store only the
MSDOS file attributes (just the owner:write attribute from VMS), and to
mark the entry as made under MSDOS (even though it wasn't).

Note that file specifications in the file system must be specified using
VMS notation, but file names in an archive must be specified using the
UNIX-like notation used in the archive.  For example, where a BACKUP
command might look like this:

<LITERAL>
$ back [.zip30...]*.* /excl = [...vms]*.c stuff.bck /save
<LARETIL>

a corresponding Zip command might look like this:

<LITERAL>
$ zip /exclude = "*/vms/*.c" stuff.zip [.zip30...]*.*
<LARETIL>

because the files to be added to the Zip archive are specified using VMS
file specifications, but the /EXCLUDE option excludes names based
on their archive path/file names.  Options dealing with archive names
include /COPY_ENTRIES, /DELETE, /EXCLUDE, /INCLUDE, and
/RECURSE=FILENAMES.

Note that a UNIX-like path specification must be quoted, or else the
slashes ("/") will confuse the command-line interpreter, causing errors
like "%CLI-W-IVQUAL, unrecognized qualifier - check validity, spelling,
and placement".

Note: By default, on VMS, archive name pattern matching (/COPY_ENTRIES,
/DELETE, /EXCLUDE, /INCLUDE, and /RECURSE=FILENAMES) is case sensitive,
even when the file system is not case sensitive (or even case
preserving).  This allows accurate matching of mixed-case names in an
archive which may have been created on a system with a case sensitive
file system, but it can involve extra effort on VMS, where it may be
necessary to use unnatural case names (or the same names in multiple
cases, like "*.obj *.OBJ") for this kind of pattern matching to give the
desired behavior.  If completely case-blind pattern matching behavior is
desired, specify the /PATTERN_CASE=BLIND option.
<TOPIC>
Modes_of_Operation

Zip supports two distinct types of command modes, external and
internal.  The external modes (update, grow, and freshen) read files
from the file system (as well as from an existing archive) while the
internal modes (delete and copy) operate exclusively on entries in an
existing archive.

<LITERAL>
  /UPDATE
<LARETIL>

Update existing entries and add new files.  If the archive does not
exist, create it.  This is the default mode, so /UPDATE is optional.

<LITERAL>
  /GROW
<LARETIL>

Grow (append to) the specified Zip archive, instead of creating a new
one.  If this operation fails, Zip attempts to restore the archive to
its original state.  If the restoration fails, the archive might become
corrupted.  This option is ignored when there's no existing archive or
when at least one archive member must be updated or deleted.

<LITERAL>
  /FRESHEN
<LARETIL>

Update existing entries in an existing archive.  Does not add new files
to the archive.

<LITERAL>
  /DELETE
<LARETIL>

Delete entries from an existing archive.

<LITERAL>
  /COPY_ENTRIES
<LARETIL>

Select entries in an existing archive and copy them to a new archive.
Copy mode is like update mode, but entries in the existing archive are
selected by command line patterns rather than files from the file system
and it uses the /OUTPUT option to write the resulting archive to a new
file rather than updating the existing archive, leaving the original
archive unchanged.

<LITERAL>
  /DIFFERENCE
<LARETIL>

Create an incremental backup-style archive, where the resulting archive
will contain all new and changed files since the original archive was
created.  For this to work, the input file list and current directory
must be the same as during the original Zip operation.

For example, if the existing archive was created using

<LITERAL>
zip foo_full.zip [.foo...]*.*
<LARETIL>

from just above the foo directory, then the command (also from just
above the foo directory):

<LITERAL>
zip /difference /output = foo_incr.zip foo_full.zip [.foo...]*.*
<LARETIL>

creates the archive foo_incr.zip with just the files not in foo_full.zip
and the files where the size or date-time of the files does not match
that in foo_full.zip.  Note that in the "ZIP /DIFFERENCE" operation, the
original full archive is specified as the input archive, and the /OUTPUT
option is used to specify the new (incremental) output archive.

<LITERAL>
  /FILESYNC
<LARETIL>

Delete entries in the archive that do not match files on the OS.
Normally files already in an archive that are not updated remain
in the archive unchanged.  The /FILESYNC option deletes files in
the archive that are not matched during the directory scan,
resulting in the archive being updated having the same contents
as a new archive would.  If much of the archive will remain
unchanged, this can be faster than creating a new archive as
copying entries is faster than compressing and adding new files.

Normally, when updating an archive using relative file specifications
("[]", "[.xxx]", and so on), it helps to have the same default directory
as when the archive was created, but this is not a strict requirement.

<TOPIC>
Self_Extracting_Archives

A self-extracting archive (SFX) comprises a normal Zip archive appended
to a special UnZip program (such as UNZIPSFX_CLI.EXE) for the intended
target system.

The UnZip distribution includes a VMS command procedure,
[,vms]makesfx.com, which can be used directly or adapted to create an
SFX archive from a normal Zip archive.

The .ZIP file format includes offsets to data structures in the archive,
and these offsets are measured from the start of the archive file.
Appending an archive to an UnZip SFX executable effectively moves the
start of the archive file.  That makes the original offsets wrong, and
that will cause the UnZip SFX program to emit warning messages when it
tries to unpack the archive.  Zip /ADJUST_OFFSETS can be used to adjust
these offsets in a self-extracting archive.  For example, to adjust the
offsets in foo.sfx_exe:

<LITERAL>
|  zip /adjust_offsets foo.sfx_exe
<LARETIL>

Similarly, the UnZip SFX program can be removed from a self-extracting
archive (and the offsets in the archive restored) using the /UNSFX
option.  For example:

<LITERAL>
|  zip /unsfx foo.sfx_exe
<LARETIL>

Note that a self-extracting archive contains a normal Zip archive, and a
normal UnZip program can be used to expand it in the normal way.  You
may get a warning about extra bytes at the beginning of the archive (the
UnZip SFX program), but UnZip should work properly after that.  This
allows data in a self-extracting archive to be accessed on any system,
not just the target system where its embedded UnZip SFX program runs.

<TOPIC>
Split_Archives

Beginning with version 3.0, Zip supports split archives.  A split
archive is one which is divided into multiple files, usually to allow it
to be stored on multiple storage media (floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, or
the like) when a single medium would be too small to contain the whole
archive.  (Note that split archives are not just unitary archives split
into pieces, as the .ZIP file format includes offsets to data structures
in the archive, and for a split archive these are based on the start of
each split, not on the start of the whole archive.  Concatenating the
pieces will invalidate these offsets, but UnZip can usually deal with
it.  Zip will usually refuse to process such a spliced archive unless
the /FIX = FULL option is used to fix the offsets.)

For a split archive with, say, 20 split files, the files are typically
named ARCHIVE.z01, ARCHIVE.z02, ..., ARCHIVE.z19, ARCHIVE.zip, where
"ARCHIVE" is the archive name specified by the user on the Zip command
line.  Note that the last split file is the ".zip" file.  In contrast,
"spanned" archives are the original multi-disk archive generally
requiring floppy disks and using volume labels to store disk numbers.
Zip supports split archives but not spanned archives, though a procedure
exists for converting split archives of the right size to spanned
archives.  The reverse is also true, where each file of a spanned
archive can be copied in order to files with the above names to create a
split archive.

<QUALIFIERS>
<QUALIFIER>
/ADJUST_OFFSETS

/ADJUST_OFFSETS

Adjust internal offsets of the Zip archive members after some data
(e.g. a SFX executable stub) has been prepended to the archive file.
<QUALIFIER>
/APPEND

/APPEND
/GROW

Grow (append to) the specified Zip archive, instead of creating a new
one.  If this operation fails, Zip attempts to restore the archive to
its original state.  If the restoration fails, the archive might become
corrupted.  This option is ignored when there's no existing archive or
when at least one archive member must be updated or deleted.

See also /DELETE /DIFFERENCE, /FRESHEN, /UPDATE.

/BATCH

/BATCH[=list_file]

Read input file specifications (inpaths) from "list_file" (one per
line).  The list_file defaults to SYS$INPUT.
<QUALIFIER>
/BEFORE

/BEFORE=VMS_date_time

Restricts the files by date-time when adding, updating, or freshening an
archive.  Only files with modification date-times earlier than the
specified date-time are accepted.

The Zip program prompts for each comment to be added, which makes sense
only if Zip is run interactively.

The one-line file (archive member) comments are terminated by typing
<Return>.  To skip a file comment, just type <Return> without entering
any further characters.

The Zip archive comment may be multi-line. The comment is ended by a
line containing just a period, or by an end-of-file character (CTRL/Z).
<QUALIFIER>
/COMPRESSION

/COMPRESSION = {BZIP2|DEFLATE|STORE}

Specify the compression method to be used when adding or updating files
in an archive.  STORE disables compression (like /LEVEL = 0).  Default:
/COMPRESSION = DEFLATE.

Zip can archive files with or without compression.  The standard
compression method ("deflate") is compatible with all UnZip versions
(except really old ones that only understand the "store" method).
Current Zip and UnZip versions may be built with optional support for
the bzip2 compression method.  (The bzip2 method can compress better,
especially when compressing highly redundant files, but uses more CPU
time, and requires an UnZip which includes the optional bzip2 support.
See the installation instructions for details on adding bzip2
compression support at build time.)
<QUALIFIER>
/COPY_ENTRIES

/COPY_ENTRIES

Select entries in an existing archive and copy them to a new archive.
Copy mode is like update mode, but entries in the existing archive are
selected by command line patterns rather than files from the file system
and it uses the /OUTPUT option to write the resulting archive to a new
file rather than updating the existing archive, leaving the original
archive unchanged.
<QUALIFIER>
/DELETE

/DELETE

Delete entries from archive.

See also /DIFFERENCE, /FRESHEN, /GROW, /UPDATE.
<QUALIFIER>
/DIFFERENCE

/DIFFERENCE

Create an incremental backup-style archive, where the resulting archive
will contain all new and changed files since the original archive was
created.  For this to work, the input file list and current directory
must be the same as during the original Zip operation.

See also /DELETE, /FRESHEN, /GROW, /UPDATE.
<QUALIFIER>
/DIRNAMES

/DIRNAMES (default)
/NODIRNAMES

Store directory entries in the archive.
<QUALIFIER>
/DISPLAY

/DISPLAY=(KEYWORD[,KEYWORD[...]])

Enable display of progress messages.
<LITERAL>
|  BYTES        Running count of bytes processed and bytes to go.
|  COUNTS       Running count of entries done and entries to go.
|  DOTS = size  Dots every <size> MB while processing files.
|               (0: no dots.)
|  GLOBALDOTS   Progress dots reflect the whole archive instead of each
|               file.
|  USIZE        Uncompressed size of each entry.
|  VOLUME       Display the volume (disk) number each entry is being
|               written to.
<LARETIL>

The default is a dot every 10 MB of input file processed.  The /VERBOSE
option also displays dots and used to at a higher rate than this (at the
same rate as in previous versions of Zip) but this rate has been changed
to the new 10 MB default, and is also controlled by /DISPLAY=DOTS=size.
<QUALIFIER>
/DOT_VERSION

/DOT_VERSION

Directs Zip to retain VMS file version numbers on names in an archive,
but as ".nnn" instead of ";nnn".  By default, for compatibility
with non-VMS systems, Zip strips VMS file version numbers from the names
stored in an archive.  Thus, without /DOT_VERSION or /KEEP_VERSION, a
version number wildcard (";*") can cause errors when multiple versions
of a single file are treated as multiple files with the same name.

See also /KEEP_VERSION.
<QUALIFIER>
/ENCRYPT

/ENCRYPT[="password"]

Encrypt new or updated archive entries using a password which is
supplied by the user interactively on the terminal in response to a
prompt.  (The password will not be echoed.)  If SYS$COMMAND is not a
terminal, Zip will exit with an error.  The password is verified before
being accepted.

You may specify the password on the command line, although we do not
recommend it because THIS IS INSECURE.  Remember to enclose the password
string with quotation marks ("pass word"), to prevent automatic
conversion to upper case or misinterpretation of punctuation characters
by DCL.

Because standard Zip encryption is weak, where security is truly
important, use a strong encryption program, such as Pretty Good Privacy
(PGP) or GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG), on an archive instead of standard
Zip encryption.  A stronger encryption method, such as AES, is planned
for Zip 3.1.
<QUALIFIER>
/EXCLUDE

/EXCLUDE=(file[,...])

A comma-separated list of files to exclude when deleting, updating, or
adding files in the archive.  If multiple files are specified, the list
should be enclosed in parentheses.
<QUALIFIER>
/EXLIST

/EXLIST=list_file

The files matching the filename patterns listed in "list_file" are
excluded when deleting, updating or adding files in the archive.
The "list_file" is a normal text file with one filename pattern entry per
line.  The name pattern entries are recognized exactly as found in
"list_file", including leading, embedded, and trailing whitespace or most
control characters (with exception of LineFeed and probably CarriageReturn).
<QUALIFIER>
/EXTRA_FIELDS

/EXTRA_FIELDS (default)
/NOEXTRA_FIELDS

Allows (or suppresses) the saving of any optional extra fields in the
archive.  (/NOEXTRA_FIELDS conflicts with /VMS[=ALL].)

The .ZIP file format allows some extra data to be stored with a file in
the archive.  For example, where local time zone information is
available, Zip can store UTC date-time data for files.  (Look for
USE_EF_UT_TIME in a "zip -v" report.)  On VMS, with /VMS[=ALL], Zip will
also store VMS-specific file attributes.  These data are packaged as
"extra fields" in the archive.  Some extra fields are specific to a
particular operating system (like VMS file attributes).  Large files
(bigger than 4GB) on any OS require an extra field to hold their 64-bit
size data.  Depending on the capabilities of the UnZip program used to
expand the archive, these extra fields may be used or ignored when files
are extracted from the archive.

Some extra fields, like UTC date-times or VMS file attributes, are
optional.  Others, like the Zip64 extra field which holds 64-bit sizes
for a large file, are required.
<QUALIFIER>
/FILESYNC

/FILESYNC

Delete entries in the archive that do not match files on the OS.
Normally when an archive is updated, new files are added and changed
files are updated but files that no longer exist on the OS are not
deleted from the archive.  This option enables deleting of entries that
are not matched on the OS.  Enabling this option should create archives
that are the same as new archives, but since existing entries are copied
instead of compressed, updating an existing archive with /FILESYNC can
be much faster than creating a new archive.  If few files are being
copied from the old archive, it may be faster to create a new archive
instead.

This option deletes files from the archive.  If you need to preserve the
original archive, make a copy of the archive first, or use the /OUTPUT
option to output the new archive to a new file.  Even though it's
slower, creating a new archive with a new archive name is safer, avoids
mismatches between archive and OS paths, and is preferred.
<QUALIFIER>
/FIX_ARCHIVE

/FIX=_ARCHIVE={NORMAL|FULL}

The /FIX_ARCHIVE=NORMAL option (NORMAL is the default) can be used if
some portions of the archive are missing, but it requires a reasonably
intact central directory.  The input archive is scanned as usual, but
zip will ignore some problems. The resulting archive should  be valid,
but any inconsistent entries will be left out.

If the archive is too damaged or the end (where the central directory is
situated) has been truncated, you must use /FIX_ARCHIVE=FULL.  This is
a change from zip 2.32, where the /FIX=NORMAL option was able to read a
truncated archive.  The /FIX=NORMAL option now more reliably fixes
archives with minor damage, and the /FIX=FULL option is needed to fix
some archives where /FIX=NORMAL was sufficient before.

With /FIX=FULL, the archive is scanned from the beginning and Zip scans
for special signatures to identify the limits between the archive
members. The /FIX=NORMAL option is more reliable if the archive is not
too much damaged, so try this option first.

Neither option will recover archives that have been incorrectly
transferred, such as by FTP in ASCII mode instead of binary.  After the
repair, the /TEST (-t) option of UnZip may show that some files have a
bad CRC. Such files cannot be recovered; you can remove them from the
archive using the /DELETE option of Zip.

Because of the uncertainty of the "fixing" process, it's required
to specify an output archive, rather than risking further damage to the
original damaged archive.  For example, to fix the damaged archive
foo.zip:

<LITERAL>
zip /fix_archive /output=foo_fix foo
<LARETIL>

tries to read the entries normally, copying good entries to the new
archive foo_fix.zip.  If this doesn't work, as when the archive is
truncated, or if some entries are missed because of bad central
directory entries, try /FIX_ARCHIVE=FULL:

<LITERAL>
zip /fix_archive=full /output=foo_fixfix foo
<LARETIL>

and compare the resulting archive to the archive created using
/FIX=NORMAL.  The /FIX=FULL option may create an inconsistent archive. 
Depending on what is damaged, you can then use the /FIX=NORMAL option to
fix that archive.

A split archive with missing split files can be fixed using /FIX=NORMAL
if you have the last split of the archive (the ".zip" file).  If this
file is missing, you must use /FIX=FULL to fix the archive, which will
prompt you for the splits you have.

Currently, the fix options can't recover an entry which has a bad
checksum or is otherwise damaged.
<QUALIFIER>
/FRESHEN

/FRESHEN

Update existing entries in an existing archive.  Does not add new files
to the archive.

See also /DELETE, /DIFFERENCE, /GROW, /UPDATE.
<QUALIFIER>
/FULL_PATH

/FULL_PATH  (default)
/NOFULL_PATH

Directs Zip to store the directory part of the file names (relative to
the current working directory) in the Zip archive.  With /NOFULL_PATH,
Zip stores only the file names, discarding any directory information.
<QUALIFIER>
/GROW

/GROW
/APPEND

Grow (append to) the specified Zip archive, instead of creating a new
one.  If this operation fails, Zip attempts to restore the archive to
its original state.  If the restoration fails, the archive might become
corrupted.  This option is ignored when there's no existing archive or
when at least one archive member must be updated or deleted.

See also /DELETE, /DIFFERENCE, /FRESHEN, /UPDATE.
<QUALIFIER>
/HELP

/HELP[=EXTENDED]

Display Zip's help screen, including the version message.  With
/HELP=EXTENDED, more detailed (longer) help information is shown.
<QUALIFIER>
/INCLUDE

/INCLUDE=(file[,...])

A comma-separated list of files to include when deleting, updating, or
adding files in the archive.  If multiple files are specified, the list
should be enclosed in parentheses.
<QUALIFIER>
/INLIST

/INLIST=list_file

The files matching the filename patterns listed in "list_file" are
included when deleting, updating, or adding files in the archive.
The "list_file" is a normal text file with one filename pattern entry per
line. The name pattern entries are recognized exactly as found in
"list_file", including leading, embedded, and trailing whitespace or most
control characters (with exception of LineFeed and probably CarriageReturn).
<QUALIFIER>
/JUNK

/JUNK
/NOJUNK (default)

Junk (discard) the directory part of the file names for added entries
(do not not save the directory structure). The /JUNK qualifier is an
alias for /NOFULL_PATH.
<QUALIFIER>
/KEEP_VERSION

/KEEP_VERSION
/NOKEEP_VERSION (default)

Directs Zip to retain VMS file version numbers on names in an archive.
By default, for compatibility with non-VMS systems, Zip strips VMS
file version numbers from the names stored in an archive.  Thus, without
/DOT_VERSION or /KEEP_VERSION, a version number wildcard (";*") can
cause errors when multiple versions of a single file are treated as
multiple files with the same name.

See also /DOT_VERSION.
<QUALIFIER>
/LATEST

/LATEST

The archive's creation and modification time is set to the latest
modification time of all archive members.
<QUALIFIER>
/LEVEL

/LEVEL=number

Specifies the compression level:
<LITERAL>
|  0      Store
|  1      Fastest compression (Defl:F)
|  ...
|  9      Best compression    (Defl:X)
<LARETIL>

The default level is 6.
<QUALIFIER>
/LICENSE

/LICENSE

Displays the Zip license.
<QUALIFIER>
/LOG_FILE

/LOG_FILE=(FILE=log_file [, APPEND] [, INFORMATIONAL])

Zip normally sends messages to the user's terminal, but these may be
also directed to a log file.

<LITERAL>
  FILE=log_file
<LARETIL>

Open a logfile at the given path.  By default, a new version will be
created.  

<LITERAL>
  APPEND
<LARETIL>

Append to an existing log file.  Default is to create a new version.

<LITERAL>
  INFORMATIONAL
<LARETIL>

Only warnings and errors are written to the log unless the INFORMATIONAL
option is also specified, then all information messages are also written
to the log.
<QUALIFIER>
/MOVE

/MOVE

Move the specified files into the Zip archive.  That is, Zip will delete
any files which are successfully added to or updated in the archive.  No
deletions will be done until the Zip operation has completed with no
errors.  This option is obviously dangerous and should be used with
care, but it does reduce the need for free disk space.  It's recommended
that /TEST also be used to test the archive before the input files are
deleted.
<QUALIFIER>
/MUST_MATCH

/MUST_MATCH

All input patterns must match at least one file and all input files
found must be readable.  Normally when an input pattern does not match
a file the "name not matched" warning is issued and when an input
file has been found but later is missing or not readable a "missing or
not readable" warning is issued.  In either case Zip continues
creating the archive, with missing or unreadable new files being skipped
and files already in the archive remaining unchanged.  After the
archive is created, if any files were not readable zip returns the OPEN
error code (18 on most systems) instead of the normal success return (0
on most systems).  With /MUST_MATCH, Zip exits as soon as an input
pattern is not matched (whenever the "name not matched" warning would be
issued) or when an input file is not readable.  In either case Zip exits
with an OPEN error and no archive is created.

This option is useful when a known list of files is to be zipped so any
missing or unreadable files should result in an error.  It may be less
useful when used with wildcards, but Zip will still exit with an error
if any input pattern doesn't match at least  one file or if any
matched files are unreadable.  If you want to create the archive anyway
and only need to know if files were skipped, then don't use /MUST_MATCH
and just check the exit status.  Also, a log file (see /LOG_FILE) could
be useful.
<QUALIFIER>
/PATTERN_CASE

/PATTERN_CASE={BLIND|SENSITIVE}

<LITERAL>
|  BLIND      Use case-blind pattern matching for archive entry names.
|  SENSITIVE  Use case-sensitive pattern matching for archive entry
|             names.  (Default.)
<LARETIL>

By default, on VMS, archive name pattern matching (/COPY_ENTRIES,
/DELETE, /EXCLUDE, /INCLUDE, and /RECURSE=FILENAMES) is case sensitive,
even when the file system is not case sensitive (or even case
preserving).  This allows accurate matching of mixed-case names in an
archive which may have been created on a system with a case sensitive
file system, but it can involve extra effort on VMS, where it may be
necessary to use unnatural case names (or the same names in multiple
cases, like "*.obj *.OBJ") for this kind of pattern matching to give the
desired behavior.  If completely case-blind pattern matching behavior is
desired, specify the /PATTERN_CASE=BLIND option.
<QUALIFIER>
/PKZIP

/PKZIP
/NOPKZIP (default)

Create PKZIP-compatible archive entries.  File names and paths are
adjusted to conform to MSDOS character-set and length
limitations, to store only the MSDOS file attributes (just the
owner:write attribute from VMS), and to mark the entry as made under
MSDOS (even though it wasn't).
<QUALIFIER>
/PRESERVE_CASE

/NOPRESERVE_CASE
/PRESERVE_CASE[=(keyword[, ...])]

Directs Zip to preserve the case of, or convert to lower-case, file names
in the archive.  Optional keywords are:
<LITERAL>
|  NOODS2        Down-case ODS2 file names (default).
|  NOODS5        Down-case ODS5 file names.
|  ODS2          Preserve case of ODS2 file names.
|  ODS5          Preserve case of ODS5 file names (default).
<LARETIL>

By default, file names from an ODS2 file system are converted to lower
case for storage in an archive, while the case of file names from an
ODS5 file system is preserved.

/NOPRESERVE_CASE is equivalent to /PRESERVE_CASE = (NOODS2, NOODS5),
which causes all file names to be converted to lower-case.  This is
equivalent to the behavior of Zip before version 3.0.

/PRESERVE_CASE is equivalent to /PRESERVE_CASE = (ODS2, ODS5), which
preserves the case of all file names.
<QUALIFIER>
/QUIET

/QUIET

Quiet mode.  Eliminates informational messages and comment prompts.
This mode may be useful in command procedures, or if the Zip operation
is being performed as a background task ("$ spawn/nowait zip /quiet foo
*.c").
<QUALIFIER>
/RECURSE

/RECURSE[=KEYWORD]
/NORECURSE (default)

Directs Zip to recurse into subdirectories.
The optional keywords recognized are:
<LITERAL>
|  PATH      take patterns as full path specifiers (-r) (default)
|  FILENAMES start from current dir;
|            only use filename part of file patterns (-R)
<LARETIL>
The optional FILENAMES keyword modifies the recursion algorithm to be
(almost) compatible to PKZIP's behaviour on subdirectory recursion.

On VMS, directory recursion can also be requested by using the
directory depth wildcard ("[...]") in an input file specification.
<QUALIFIER>
/SHOW

/SHOW=(KEYWORD[,KEYWORD[...]])

Controls various diagnostic messages.

The keywords recognized are:
<LITERAL>
|  COMMAND  Show command line arguments as processed (only, then exit).
|  DEBUG    Show Debug information.
|  FILES    Show files to process (only, then exit).
|  OPTIONS  Show all available command-line options on this system.
<LARETIL>
<QUALIFIER>
/SINCE

/SINCE=VMS_date_time

Restricts the files by date-time when adding, updating, or freshening an
archive.  Only files with modification date-times at or later than the
specified date-time are accepted.

See also /BEFORE.
<QUALIFIER>
/SPLIT

/SPLIT = (SIZE=size [, PAUSE [, BELL]] [, VERBOSE])

Enables split archives, specifies the size of the splits, and controls
other related behavior.

SIZE=size  specifies the split size.  The size is given as a number
followed optionally by a multiplier suffix of k (KB), m (MB, the default
if no suffix is specified), g (GB), or t (TB).  (All are powers of 1024,
not 1000).  64K is the minimum split size.  For example, the following
command could be used to create a split archive called "foo" from the
contents of the "bar" directory with splits of 670MB, which might be
useful for burning on CDs:

<LITERAL>
|  zip /split = size = 670m foo [.bar...]*.*
<LARETIL>

Using /SPLIT without PAUSE as above creates all the splits in the
directory
specified by "foo", in this case the current default directory.  This
split mode updates the splits as the archive is being created, requiring
all splits to remain writable, but creates split archives that are
readable by any UnZip that supports split archives.  See PAUSE below for
enabling split pause mode which allows splits to be written directly to
removable media.

PAUSE  causes Zip to pause between splits to allow
changing removable media, for example.  PAUSE uses stream mode to
write splits so unzips that can't read stream mode entries may not
be able to read some entries in the archive.  Unless standard encryption
was used, copy mode using /COPY_ENTRIES can convert stream mode entries
to normal entries.

BELL  ring the terminal bell when Zip pauses for the next split
destination.

VERBOSE  enables verbose splitting and display details of how the
splitting is being done.

Though Zip does not update split archives, Zip provides the option
/OUTPUT to allow split archives to be updated and saved in a new
archive.  For example:

<LITERAL>
|  zip inarchive.zip foo.c bar.c /output = outarchive.zip
<LARETIL>

reads archive inarchive.zip, even if split, adds the files foo.c and
bar.c, and writes the resulting archive to outarchive.zip.  If
inarchive.zip is split, then outarchive.zip defaults to the same split
size.  Be aware that outarchive.zip and any split files that are created
with it are always overwritten without warning.  This may be changed in
the future.
<QUALIFIER>
/STORE_TYPES

/STORE_TYPES=(.ext1,.ext2,... )

Normally, a file which is already compressed will not be compressed much
further (if at all) by Zip, and trying to do it can waste considerable
CPU time.  Zip can suppress compression on files with particular types,
specified with /STORE_TYPES.  The default list of types where
compression is suppressed is /STORE_TYPES=(.Z, .zip, .zoo, .arc, .lzh,
 .arj), and the comparison is case-insensitive.

/LEVEL=9 will override /STORE_TYPES, causing compression to be attempted
for all files.
<QUALIFIER>
/SYMLINKS

/SYMLINKS

Store symbolic links as such in the Zip archive, instead of compressing
and storing the file referred to by the link.  A symbolic link normally
requires less storage than the actual file, both in the archive, and on
the destination file system.

On VMS, symbolic links are supported on ODS5 disks where the C RTL
supports symbolic links.  Full support for symbolic links seems to
require VMS V8.3, but a Zip program supporting symbolic links may be
built on VMS V7.3-2.
<QUALIFIER>
/TEMP_PATH

/TEMP_PATH=temp_dir

When creating a new archive or normally when changing an existing
archive, Zip will write a temporary file in the archive destination
directory ("ZIxxxxxxxx", where "xxxxxxxx" is the hexadecimal process ID)
with the new contents.  Then, if and when the Zip job has completed with
no errors, it will rename the temporary file to the specified archive
name (replacing the old archive, if any).

/TEMP_PATH=temp_dir specifies an alternate device:[directory],
"temp_dir", for the temporary file, but specifying a different device
will force Zip to copy the temporary file to its final destination
instead of simply renaming it, and that copying will take more time than
renaming, especially for a large archive.  For example:

<LITERAL>
|  zip /temp_path = disk$scratch:[tmp] stuff *
<LARETIL>

will cause Zip to put its temporary files in the directory
"disk$scratch:[tmp]", copying the temporary file back to the current
directory as stuff.zip when it's complete.
<QUALIFIER>
/TEST

/TEST[=UNZIP=unzip_cmd]

Test the integrity of a Zip archive (the new one, if /OUTPUT is
specified).  If the check fails, the old archive is unchanged  and
(with the /MOVE option) no input files are removed.

Implementation
"zip /TEST" actually runs an "unzip -t" command to do the testing, so
UnZip must be installed properly for this to work.

With UNZIP=unzip_cmd, Zip uses the UnZip command specified by
"unzip_cmd" (normally a DCL symbol), instead of the default command,
"unzip -t".  This can be useful if multiple versions of UnZip are
installed on a system, and the default DCL symbol "UNZIP" would run the
wrong one (or the logical name DCL$PATH would lead to the wrong one).

In "unzip_cmd", the string "{}" is replaced by the name of the
(temporary) archive to be tested, otherwise the name of the archive is
appended to the end of the command.  The exit status is checked for
success severity.
<QUALIFIER>
/TRANSLATE_EOL

/TRANSLATE_EOL[=KEYWORD]

Selects conversion of the end-of-line markers in text files.  This
option should be used on text files only.  The optional keywords
recognized are:
<LITERAL>
|  LF        convert LF -> CRLF (UNIX to DOS) (default)
|  CRLF      convert CRLF -> LF, strip trailing CTRL-Z's (DOS to UNIX)
<LARETIL>

The CRLF option may be useful when a DOS text file has been transfered
to a VMS disk in stream (or stream_lf) format.
<QUALIFIER>
/UNSFX

/UNSFX

Strip any prepended data from the Zip archive.  ZIP /UNSFX is normally
used to convert a self-extracting archive to a normal archive by
removing the UnZip SFX executable from the beginning of the SFX archive.

Note that a self-extracting archive contains a normal Zip archive, and a
normal UnZip program can be used to expand it in the normal way.  You
may get a warning about extra bytes at the beginning of the archive (the
UnZip SFX program), but UnZip should work properly after that.  This
allows data in a self-extracting archive to be accessed on any system,
not just the target system where its embedded UnZip SFX program runs.
<QUALIFIER>
/UPDATE

/UPDATE

Update existing archive entries and add new files.  If the archive does
not exist, create it.  This is the default mode, so /UPDATE is optional.

See also /DELETE /DIFFERENCE, /GROW, /FRESHEN.
<QUALIFIER>
/VERBOSE

/VERBOSE[=NORMAL|MORE|DEBUG] [, COMMAND]]

Verbose mode or print diagnostic version info.

Normally, when applied to real operations, this option enables the
display of a progress indicator during compression (see /DISPLAY=DOTS
for more on dots) and requests verbose diagnostic info about archive
structure oddities.

/VERBOSE with no value is equivalent to /VERBOSE=NORMAL.  MORE adds more
messages, and DEBUG adds still more messages.

When /VERBOSE is the only command line argument, a diagnostic report is
displayed, showing:

<LITERAL>
|  o Copyright and other legal notices
|  o Program name, version, and release date
|  o Pointers to Info-ZIP FTP and Web sites
|  o Program build information (compiler type and version, OS version,
|    and the compilation date
|  o Optional features enabled at compile-time
|  o Environment variable definitions (ZIP_OPTS, ZIPOPT)
<LARETIL>

This information should be included in bug reports.

/VERBOSE=COMMAND causes Zip to display the UNIX-style command-line
argument vector which is generated from the VMS-style CLI command line
before executing the command.  This is of primary interest to program
developers debugging the CLI.
<QUALIFIER>
/VMS

/VMS[=ALL]

The /VMS and /VMS=ALL options cause Zip to store VMS file atributes
(such as file organization, record format, carriage control, and so on)
in VMS-specific "extra fields" in an archive along with the usual data.
These extra fields are ignored on non-VMS systems, but on a VMS system,
they allow UnZip to restore the files with their VMS attributes intact.

With /VMS, Zip ignores any data in the file after the end-of-file (EOF)
point (defined by FAT$L_EFBLK and FAT$W_FFBYTE), which works well for
well-formed files (that is, those with no valid data beyond EOF).
Portable-format files (Stream_LF, fixed-512) archived with /VMS should
be extracted properly on a non-VMS system.  Files with more complex
structures, such as indexed files and files with embedded byte counts or
other such data may be of limited use on other systems.  (UnZip on
non-VMS systems may be able to extract various VMS-format text files,
however.)

With /VMS=ALL, Zip processes all allocated blocks for the file
(including those beyond EOF).  When extracted on a VMS system, the
original file should be reproduced with as much fidelity as possible,
but on a non-VMS system, most files will be seen as corrupt because of
the data from beyond EOF.
<QUALIFIER>
/WILDCARD

<LITERAL>
/NOWILDCARD
/WILDCARD=NOSPAN
<LARETIL>

Controls wildcard processing.

/NOWILDCARD  Wildcard processing is disabled.

/WILDCARD=NOSPAN  Wildcards don't span directory boundaries in paths.
<QUALIFIER>
/ZIP64

/ZIP64

Forces use of Zip64 archive format, even for small files.  This is
mainly for testing and should never be used.  Zip will automatically
use Zip64 as needed without this option.
<TOPIC>
UNIX_Options

"zip -h" provides a concise list of common command-line options.  "zip
-h2" provides more details.  "zip -so" provides a list of all available
options.  "zip -v" shows the program version and available features.
(The list below was derived from a "zip -so" listing.)

Short-form options begin with a single hyphen ("-").  Long-form option
begin with a double hyphen ("--"), and may be abbreviated to any
unambiguous shorter string.  For example:

<LITERAL>
|  -v
|  --verbose
|  --verb
<LARETIL>

To avoid confusion, if a negatable option contains an embedded hyphen
("-"), then avoid abbreviating it at the hyphen if you plan to negate
it.  For example, if an option like --some-option were abbreviated to
--some-, the parser would consider that trailing hyphen to be part of
the option name, rather than as a negating trailing hyphen.  This
behavior may change in the future, to interpret the trailing hyphen in
--some- to be negating.  (So don't do it.)

Some options may be negated (or modified) by appending a "-":

<LITERAL>
|  -la-
|  --show-files-
<LARETIL>

Some options take a value, which may immediately follow the option, or
be separated by a space or "=".  For example:
<LITERAL>
|  -ttmmddyyyy
|  -tt mmddyyyy
|  -tt=mmddyyyy

With SET PROCESS /PARSE_STYLE = EXTENDED (available on recent non-VAX
systems), Zip preserves the case of the command line.  Otherwise, mixed-
or upper-case options and arguments must be quoted.  For example,
"-V".  Examples in this document generally do not show this quotation.
