DESCRIPTION
       zipcloak encrypts all unencrypted entries in the zipfile.  This is  the
       default action.

       The -d option is used to decrypt encrypted entries in the zipfile.

       zipcloak uses original zip encryption which is considered weak.

       Note:  The  encryption  code  of this program is not copyrighted and is
              put in the public domain.  It was originally written  in  Europe
              and  can  be  freely  distributed from any country including the
              U.S.A.  (Previously if this program was imported into the U.S.A,
              it  could not be re-exported from the U.S.A to another country.)
              See the file README.CR included in the source  distribution  for
              more on this.  Otherwise, the Info-ZIP license applies.

EXAMPLES
       To be added.

BUGS
       Large files (> 2 GB) and large archives not yet supported.

       Split  archives  not  yet  supported.   A work around is to convert the
       split archive to a single-file archive using zip and then use  zipcloak
       on  the single-file archive.  If needed, the resulting archive can then
       be split again using zip.
