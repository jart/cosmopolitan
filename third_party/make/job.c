/* Determine if the load average on the system is too high to start a new job.

   On systems which provide /proc/loadavg (e.g., Linux), we use an idea
   provided by Sven C. Dack <sven.c.dack@sky.com>: retrieve the current number
   of runnable processes, if it's greater than the requested load we don't
   allow another job to start.  We allow a job to start with equal processes
   since one of those will be for make itself, which will then pause waiting
   for jobs to clear.

   If /proc/loadavg is not available for some reason, we obtain the system
   load average and compare that.

   The system load average is only recomputed once every N (N>=1) seconds.
   However, a very parallel make can easily start tens or even hundreds of
   jobs in a second, which brings the system to its knees for a while until
   that first batch of jobs clears out.

   To avoid this we use a weighted algorithm to try to account for jobs which
   have been started since the last second, and guess what the load average
   would be now if it were computed.

   This algorithm was provided by Thomas Riedl <thomas.riedl@siemens.com>,
   based on load average being recomputed once per second, which is
   (apparently) how Solaris operates.  Linux recomputes only once every 5
   seconds, but Linux is handled by the /proc/loadavg algorithm above.

   Thomas writes:

!      calculate something load-oid and add to the observed sys.load,
!      so that latter can catch up:
!      - every job started increases jobctr;
!      - every dying job decreases a positive jobctr;
!      - the jobctr value gets zeroed every change of seconds,
!        after its value*weight_b is stored into the 'backlog' value last_sec
!      - weight_a times the sum of jobctr and last_sec gets
!        added to the observed sys.load.
!
!      The two weights have been tried out on 24 and 48 proc. Sun Solaris-9
!      machines, using a several-thousand-jobs-mix of cpp, cc, cxx and smallish
!      sub-shelled commands (rm, echo, sed...) for tests.
!      lowering the 'direct influence' factor weight_a (e.g. to 0.1)
!      resulted in significant excession of the load limit, raising it
!      (e.g. to 0.5) took bad to small, fast-executing jobs and didn't
!      reach the limit in most test cases.
!
!      lowering the 'history influence' weight_b (e.g. to 0.1) resulted in
!      exceeding the limit for longer-running stuff (compile jobs in
!      the .5 to 1.5 sec. range),raising it (e.g. to 0.5) overrepresented
!      small jobs' effects.

       The shell wildcard characters are in DOS_CHARS because they will
       not be expanded if we call the child via 'spawnXX'.

       The ';' is in DOS_CHARS, because our 'system' knows how to run
       multiple commands on a single line.
