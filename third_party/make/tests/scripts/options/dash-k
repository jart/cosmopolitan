The makefile created in this test is a simulation of building
a small product.  However, the trick to this one is that one
of the dependencies of the main target does not exist.
Without the -k option, make would fail immediately and not
build any part of the target.  What we are looking for here,
is that make builds the rest of the dependencies even though
it knows that at the end it will fail to rebuild the main target.";
