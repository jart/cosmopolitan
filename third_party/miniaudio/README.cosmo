DESCRIPTION

  miniaudio is an enormous audio library rolled into one file.

  cosmopolitan uses this for two things:

    1. we build miniaudio as part of the cosmopolitan monorepo, but only
       for its audio encoding / decoding features. this lets us
       statically link support for mp3/wav/etc.

    2. we bundle miniaudio.h as a zip file inside actually portable
       executables, so that programs which link our cosmoaudio wrapper
       can extract it and build a dso with the host compiler. we then
       dynamically link that dso at runtime. this is how we interface
       with the microphone and speaker.
