ZIPINFO(1L)                                                        ZIPINFO(1L)

NAME
       zipinfo - list detailed information about a ZIP archive

SYNOPSIS
       zipinfo [-12smlvhMtTz] file[.zip] [file(s) ...] [-x xfile(s) ...]

       unzip -Z [-12smlvhMtTz] file[.zip] [file(s) ...] [-x xfile(s) ...]

DESCRIPTION
       zipinfo  lists technical information about files in a ZIP archive, most
       commonly found on  MS-DOS  systems.   Such  information  includes  file
       access permissions, encryption status, type of compression, version and
       operating system or file system of compressing program, and  the  like.
       The  default  behavior (with no options) is to list single-line entries
       for each file in the archive, with header and trailer  lines  providing
       summary  information  for  the  entire  archive.  The format is a cross
       between Unix ``ls -l'' and ``unzip -v'' output.  See DETAILED  DESCRIP-
       TION  below.   Note  that  zipinfo  is the same program as unzip (under
       Unix, a link to it); on some systems, however, zipinfo support may have
       been omitted when unzip was compiled.

ARGUMENTS
       file[.zip]
              Path  of  the  ZIP  archive(s).   If the file specification is a
              wildcard, each matching file is processed in an order determined
              by the operating system (or file system).  Only the filename can
              be a wildcard; the path itself cannot.  Wildcard expressions are
              similar to Unix egrep(1) (regular) expressions and may contain:

              *      matches a sequence of 0 or more characters

              ?      matches exactly 1 character

              [...]  matches  any  single character found inside the brackets;
                     ranges are specified by a beginning character, a  hyphen,
                     and  an  ending  character.  If an exclamation point or a
                     caret (`!' or `^') follows the  left  bracket,  then  the
                     range  of  characters within the brackets is complemented
                     (that is,  anything  except  the  characters  inside  the
                     brackets  is  considered a match).  To specify a verbatim
                     left bracket, the three-character sequence ``[[]'' has to
                     be used.

              (Be  sure  to quote any character that might otherwise be inter-
              preted or modified by the operating system,  particularly  under
              Unix  and  VMS.)   If no matches are found, the specification is
              assumed to be a literal filename; and if that  also  fails,  the
              suffix  .zip  is  appended.  Note that self-extracting ZIP files
              are supported, as with any other ZIP archive; just  specify  the
              .exe suffix (if any) explicitly.

       [file(s)]
              An  optional  list of archive members to be processed, separated
              by spaces.  (VMS versions  compiled  with  VMSCLI  defined  must
              delimit  files with commas instead.)  Regular expressions (wild-
              cards) may be used to match multiple members; see above.  Again,
              be sure to quote expressions that would otherwise be expanded or
              modified by the operating system.

       [-x xfile(s)]
              An optional list of archive members to be excluded from process-
              ing.

OPTIONS
       -1     list  filenames  only,  one  per line.  This option excludes all
              others;  headers,  trailers  and  zipfile  comments  are   never 
             printed.  It is intended for use in Unix shell scripts.

       -2     list  filenames  only,  one  per  line,  but allow headers (-h),
              trailers (-t) and zipfile comments (-z), as well.   This  option
              may  be  useful in cases where the stored filenames are particu-
              larly long.

       -s     list zipfile info in short Unix ``ls -l'' format.  This  is  the
              default behavior; see below.

       -m     list zipfile info in medium Unix ``ls -l'' format.  Identical to
              the -s output, except that the compression factor, expressed  as
              a percentage, is also listed.

       -l     list  zipfile  info  in  long Unix ``ls -l'' format.  As with -m
              except that the compressed size (in bytes) is printed instead of
              the compression ratio.

       -v     list zipfile information in verbose, multi-page format.

       -h     list  header line.  The archive name, actual size (in bytes) and
              total number of files is printed.

       -M     pipe all output through an internal pager similar  to  the  Unix
              more(1)  command.   At the end of a screenful of output, zipinfo
              pauses with a ``--More--'' prompt; the  next  screenful  may  be
              viewed  by  pressing  the  Enter  (Return) key or the space bar.
              zipinfo can be terminated by pressing the ``q'' key and, on some
              systems, the Enter/Return key.  Unlike Unix more(1), there is no
              forward-searching or editing capability.  Also, zipinfo  doesn't
              notice if long lines wrap at the edge of the screen, effectively
              resulting in the printing of two or more lines and  the  likeli-
              hood that some text will scroll off the top of the screen before
              being viewed.  On some systems the number of available lines  on
              the  screen  is  not detected, in which case zipinfo assumes the
              height is 24 lines.

       -t     list totals for files listed or for all files.   The  number  of
              files  listed,  their  uncompressed and compressed total sizes ,
              and their overall compression factor is printed; or, if only the
              totals  line is being printed, the values for the entire archive
              are given.  The compressed total size does not  include  the  12
              additional  header  bytes of each encrypted entry. Note that the
              total compressed (data) size will never match the actual zipfile
              size,  since  the  latter  includes  all of the internal zipfile
              headers in addition to the compressed data.

       -T     print the file dates and times  in  a  sortable  decimal  format
              (yymmdd.hhmmss).   The  default  date format is a more standard,
              human-readable version with abbreviated month names  (see  exam-
              ples below).

       -U     [UNICODE_SUPPORT  only]  modify or disable UTF-8 handling.  When
              UNICODE_SUPPORT is available, the  option  -U  forces  unzip  to
              escape  all  non-ASCII  characters from UTF-8 coded filenames as
              ``#Uxxxx''.  This option is mainly provided for  debugging  pur-
              pose when the fairly new UTF-8 support is suspected to mangle up
              extracted filenames.

              The option -UU allows to entirely  disable  the  recognition  of
              UTF-8  encoded  filenames.   The  handling  of  filename codings
              within unzip falls back to the behaviour of previous versions.

       -z     include the archive comment (if any) in the listing.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
       zipinfo has a number of modes, and its behavior can be rather difficult
       to  fathom  if  one isn't familiar with Unix ls(1) (or even if one is).
       The default behavior is to list files in the following format:

  -rw-rws---  1.9 unx    2802 t- defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660

       The last three fields are the modification date and time of  the  file,
       and  its  name.  The case of the filename is respected; thus files that
       come from MS-DOS PKZIP are always capitalized.  If the file was  zipped
       with  a  stored  directory  name, that is also displayed as part of the
       filename.

       The second and third fields indicate that the  file  was  zipped  under
       Unix  with version 1.9 of zip.  Since it comes from Unix, the file per-
       missions at the beginning of the line are printed in Unix format.   The
       uncompressed file-size (2802 in this example) is the fourth field.

       The fifth field consists of two characters, either of which may take on
       several values.  The first character may be either `t' or `b', indicat-
       ing  that zip believes the file to be text or binary, respectively; but
       if the file is encrypted, zipinfo notes this fact by  capitalizing  the
       character  (`T'  or  `B').   The second character may also take on four
       values, depending on whether there is an extended local  header  and/or
       an  ``extra  field''  associated  with  the  file  (fully  explained in
       PKWare's APPNOTE.TXT,  but  basically  analogous  to  pragmas  in  ANSI
       C--i.e.,  they  provide a standard way to include non-standard informa-
       tion in the archive).  If neither  exists,  the  character  will  be  a
       hyphen  (`-'); if there is an extended local header but no extra field,
       `l'; if the reverse, `x'; and if both exist, `X'.   Thus  the  file  in
       this  example is (probably) a text file, is not encrypted, and has nei-
       ther an extra field nor an extended local header  associated  with  it.
       The  example below, on the other hand, is an encrypted binary file with
       an extra field:

  RWD,R,R     0.9 vms     168 Bx shrk  9-Aug-91 19:15 perms.0644

       Extra fields are used for various purposes (see discussion  of  the  -v
       option  below)  including  the storage of VMS file attributes, which is
       presumably the case here.  Note that the file attributes are listed  in
       VMS  format.   Some  other  possibilities for the host operating system
       (which is actually  a  misnomer--host  file  system  is  more  correct)
       include  OS/2  or  NT with High Performance File System (HPFS), MS-DOS,
       OS/2 or NT with File Allocation Table (FAT) file system, and Macintosh.
       These are denoted as follows:

  -rw-a--     1.0 hpf    5358 Tl i4:3  4-Dec-91 11:33 longfilename.hpfs
  -r--ahs     1.1 fat    4096 b- i4:2 14-Jul-91 12:58 EA DATA. SF
  --w-------  1.0 mac   17357 bx i8:2  4-May-92 04:02 unzip.macr

       File  attributes  in  the  first two cases are indicated in a Unix-like
       format, where the seven subfields indicate whether the file:  (1) is  a
       directory,  (2) is readable (always true), (3) is writable, (4) is exe-
       cutable (guessed on the basis of the extension--.exe, .com, .bat,  .cmd
       and  .btm files are assumed to be so), (5) has its archive bit set, (6)
       is hidden, and (7) is a system file.  Interpretation of Macintosh  file
       attributes  is  unreliable because some Macintosh archivers don't store
       any attributes in the archive.

       Finally, the sixth field indicates the compression method and  possible
       sub-method  used.  There are six methods known at present:  storing (no
       compression), reducing, shrinking, imploding,  tokenizing  (never  pub-
       licly  released), and deflating.  In addition, there are four levels of
       reducing (1 through 4); four types of imploding (4K or 8K sliding  dic-
       tionary,  and  2 or 3 Shannon-Fano trees); and four levels of deflating
       (superfast, fast, normal,  maximum  compression).   zipinfo  represents
       these  methods  and  their  sub-methods  as follows:  stor; re:1, re:2,
       etc.; shrk; i4:2, i8:3, etc.; tokn; and defS, defF, defN, and defX.

       The medium and long listings are almost identical to the  short  format
       except that they add information on the file's compression.  The medium
       format lists the file's compression factor as a  percentage  indicating
       the amount of space that has been ``removed'':

  -rw-rws---  1.5 unx    2802 t- 81% defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660

       In  this example, the file has been compressed by more than a factor of
       five; the compressed data are only 19% of the original size.  The  long
       format gives the compressed file's size in bytes, instead:

  -rw-rws---  1.5 unx    2802 t-     538 defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660

       In  contrast to the unzip listings, the compressed size figures in this
       listing format denote the complete size of compressed  data,  including
       the 12 extra header bytes in case of encrypted entries.

       Adding the -T option changes the file date and time to decimal format:

  -rw-rws---  1.5 unx    2802 t-     538 defX 910811.134804 perms.2660

       Note  that  because  of  limitations in the MS-DOS format used to store
       file times, the seconds field is always rounded  to  the  nearest  even
       second.   For  Unix  files this is expected to change in the next major
       releases of zip(1L) and unzip.

       In addition to individual file information, a default  zipfile  listing
       also includes header and trailer lines:

  Archive:  OS2.zip   5453 bytes   5 files
  ,,rw,       1.0 hpf     730 b- i4:3 26-Jun-92 23:40 Contents
  ,,rw,       1.0 hpf    3710 b- i4:3 26-Jun-92 23:33 makefile.os2
  ,,rw,       1.0 hpf    8753 b- i8:3 26-Jun-92 15:29 os2unzip.c
  ,,rw,       1.0 hpf      98 b- stor 21-Aug-91 15:34 unzip.def
  ,,rw,       1.0 hpf      95 b- stor 21-Aug-91 17:51 zipinfo.def
  5 files, 13386 bytes uncompressed, 4951 bytes compressed:  63.0%

       The  header line gives the name of the archive, its total size, and the
       total number of files; the trailer gives the number  of  files  listed,
       their  total  uncompressed  size,  and their total compressed size (not
       including any of zip's internal overhead).  If, however,  one  or  more
       file(s)  are  provided,  the  header  and trailer lines are not listed.
       This behavior is also similar to that of Unix's ``ls -l'';  it  may  be
       overridden  by  specifying the -h and -t options explicitly.  In such a
       case the listing format must also be specified explicitly, since -h  or
       -t  (or  both)  in  the  absence of other options implies that ONLY the
       header or trailer line (or both) is listed.  See the  EXAMPLES  section
       below for a semi-intelligible translation of this nonsense.

       The  verbose  listing  is  mostly self-explanatory.  It also lists file
       comments and the zipfile comment, if any, and the type  and  number  of
       bytes  in  any  stored  extra  fields.   Currently known types of extra
       fields include PKWARE's authentication  (``AV'')  info;  OS/2  extended
       attributes;  VMS  filesystem  info,  both PKWARE and Info-ZIP versions;
       Macintosh resource forks; Acorn/Archimedes SparkFS  info;  and  so  on.
       (Note  that  in  the case of OS/2 extended attributes--perhaps the most
       common use of zipfile extra fields--the  size  of  the  stored  EAs  as
       reported  by  zipinfo may not match the number given by OS/2's dir com-
       mand: OS/2 always reports the number of bytes required in  16-bit  for-
       mat, whereas zipinfo always reports the 32-bit storage.)

       Again,  the  compressed  size figures of the individual entries include
       the 12 extra header bytes for  encrypted  entries.   In  contrast,  the
       archive  total  compressed size and the average compression ratio shown
       in the summary bottom line are calculated without the extra  12  header
       bytes of encrypted entries.

ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS
       Modifying  zipinfo's default behavior via options placed in an environ-
       ment variable can be a bit complicated to  explain,  due  to  zipinfo's
       attempts  to  handle  various  defaults in an intuitive, yet Unix-like,
       manner.  (Try not to laugh.)  Nevertheless, there  is  some  underlying
       logic.   In brief, there are three ``priority levels'' of options:  the
       default options; environment options, which can override or add to  the
       defaults; and explicit options given by the user, which can override or
       add to either of the above.

       The default listing format, as noted above, corresponds roughly to  the
       "zipinfo  -hst"  command  (except  when  individual zipfile members are
       specified).  A user who prefers the long-listing format (-l)  can  make
       use of the zipinfo's environment variable to change this default:

       Unix Bourne shell:
              ZIPINFO=-l; export ZIPINFO

       Unix C shell:
              setenv ZIPINFO -l

       OS/2 or MS-DOS:
              set ZIPINFO=-l

       VMS (quotes for lowercase):
              define ZIPINFO_OPTS "-l"

       If,  in addition, the user dislikes the trailer line, zipinfo's concept
       of ``negative options'' may be used to override the  default  inclusion
       of  the  line.   This is accomplished by preceding the undesired option
       with one or more minuses:  e.g., ``-l-t'' or ``--tl'', in this example.
       The  first  hyphen  is the regular switch character, but the one before
       the `t' is a minus sign.  The dual use of hyphens  may  seem  a  little
       awkward,  but it's reasonably intuitive nonetheless:  simply ignore the
       first hyphen and go from there.  It is also consistent with the  behav-
       ior of the Unix command nice(1).

       As suggested above, the default variable names are ZIPINFO_OPTS for VMS
       (where the symbol used to install zipinfo as a  foreign  command  would
       otherwise  be  confused with the environment variable), and ZIPINFO for
       all other operating systems.  For compatibility  with  zip(1L),  ZIPIN-
       FOOPT is also accepted (don't ask).  If both ZIPINFO and ZIPINFOOPT are
       defined, however, ZIPINFO takes precedence.  unzip's diagnostic  option
       (-v  with  no zipfile name) can be used to check the values of all four
       possible unzip and zipinfo environment variables.

EXAMPLES
       To get a basic, short-format listing of the complete contents of a  ZIP
       archive  storage.zip,  with  both header and totals lines, use only the
       archive name as an argument to zipinfo:

           zipinfo storage

       To produce a basic, long-format listing (not verbose), including header
       and totals lines, use -l:

           zipinfo -l storage

       To  list the complete contents of the archive without header and totals
       lines, either negate the -h and -t options or else specify the contents
       explicitly:

           zipinfo --h-t storage
           zipinfo storage \*

       (where  the  backslash  is  required  only if the shell would otherwise
       expand the `*' wildcard, as in Unix when globbing is turned  on--double
       quotes around the asterisk would have worked as well).  To turn off the
       totals line by default,  use  the  environment  variable  (C  shell  is
       assumed here):

           setenv ZIPINFO --t
           zipinfo storage

       To get the full, short-format listing of the first example again, given
       that the environment variable is set as in the previous example, it  is
       necessary  to  specify the -s option explicitly, since the -t option by
       itself implies that ONLY the footer line is to be printed:

           setenv ZIPINFO --t
           zipinfo -t storage            [only totals line]
           zipinfo -st storage           [full listing]

       The -s option, like -m and -l, includes headers and footers by default,
       unless  otherwise  specified.  Since the environment variable specified
       no footers and that has a higher precedence than the  default  behavior
       of -s, an explicit -t option was necessary to produce the full listing.
       Nothing was indicated about the header, however, so the -s  option  was
       sufficient.   Note  that both the -h and -t options, when used by them-
       selves or with each other,  override  any  default  listing  of  member
       files;  only  the  header  and/or footer are printed.  This behavior is
       useful when zipinfo is used with a wildcard zipfile specification;  the
       contents of all zipfiles are then summarized with a single command.

       To list information on a single file within the archive, in medium for-
       mat, specify the filename explicitly:

           zipinfo -m storage unshrink.c

       The specification of any member file, as in this example, will override
       the  default  header and totals lines; only the single line of informa-
       tion about the requested file will be  printed.   This  is  intuitively
       what  one would expect when requesting information about a single file.
       For multiple files, it is often useful to know the total compressed and
       uncompressed size; in such cases -t may be specified explicitly:

           zipinfo -mt storage "*.[ch]" Mak\*

       To  get  maximal  information  about  the  ZIP archive, use the verbose
       option.  It is usually wise to pipe the output into a  filter  such  as
       Unix more(1) if the operating system allows it:

           zipinfo -v storage | more

       Finally,  to  see  the most recently modified files in the archive, use
       the -T option in conjunction with an external sorting utility  such  as
       Unix sort(1) (and sed(1) as well, in this example):

           zipinfo -T storage | sort -nr -k 7 | sed 15q

       The -nr option to sort(1) tells it to sort numerically in reverse order
       rather than in textual order, and the -k 7 option tells it to  sort  on
       the  seventh  field.  This assumes the default short-listing format; if
       -m or -l is used, the proper sort(1) option would be -k 8.  Older  ver-
       sions  of  sort(1)  do  not  support the -k option, but you can use the
       traditional + option instead, e.g., +6 instead  of  -k 7.   The  sed(1)
       command  filters out all but the first 15 lines of the listing.  Future
       releases of zipinfo may incorporate date/time and filename  sorting  as
       built-in options.

TIPS
       The  author  finds  it  convenient to define an alias ii for zipinfo on
       systems that allow aliases (or, on other systems, copy/rename the  exe-
       cutable, create a link or create a command file with the name ii).  The
       ii usage parallels the common ll alias for long listings in  Unix,  and
       the similarity between the outputs of the two commands was intentional.

BUGS
       As with unzip, zipinfo's -M (``more'') option is overly  simplistic  in
       its  handling  of screen output; as noted above, it fails to detect the
       wrapping of long lines and may thereby cause lines at the  top  of  the
       screen to be scrolled off before being read.  zipinfo should detect and
       treat each occurrence of line-wrap  as  one  additional  line  printed.
       This  requires  knowledge  of the screen's width as well as its height.
       In addition, zipinfo should detect the true screen geometry on all sys-
       tems.

       zipinfo's  listing-format  behavior is unnecessarily complex and should
       be simplified.  (This is not to say that it will be.)
