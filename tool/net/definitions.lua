SYNOPSIS

  redbean [-?BVabdfghjkmsuvz] [-p PORT] [-D DIR] [-- SCRIPTARGS...]

DESCRIPTION

  redbean - single-file distributable web server

OVERVIEW

  redbean makes it possible to share web applications that run offline
  as a single-file Actually Portable Executable PKZIP archive which
  contains your assets.

  redbean can serve 1 million+ gzip encoded responses per second on a
  cheap personal computer. That performance is thanks to zip and gzip
  using the same compression format, which enables kernelspace copies.
  Another reason redbean goes fast is that it's a tiny static binary,
  which makes fork memory paging nearly free.

  redbean is also easy to modify to suit your own needs. The program
  itself is written as a single .c file. It embeds the Lua programming
  language and SQLite which let you write dynamic pages.

USAGE

  This executable is also a ZIP file that contains static assets.
  You can run redbean interactively in your terminal as follows:

    ./redbean -vvvmbag        # starts server verbosely
    open http://127.0.0.1:8080/   # shows zip listing page
    CTRL-C                        # 1x: graceful shutdown
    CTRL-C                        # 2x: forceful shutdown

  You can override the default listing page by adding:

    zip redbean index.lua     # lua server pages take priority
    zip redbean index.html    # default page for directory

  The listing page only applies to the root directory. However the
  default index page applies to subdirectories too. In order for it
  to work, there needs to be an empty directory entry in the zip.
  That should already be the default practice of your zip editor.

    wget                     \
      --mirror               \
      --convert-links        \
      --adjust-extension     \
      --page-requisites      \
      --no-parent            \
      --no-if-modified-since \
      http://a.example/index.html
    zip -r redbean a.example/  # default page for directory

  redbean normalizes the trailing slash for you automatically:

    $ printf 'GET /a.example HTTP/1.0\n\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 8080
    HTTP/1.0 307 Temporary Redirect
    Location: /a.example/

  Virtual hosting is accomplished this way too. The Host is simply
  prepended to the path, and if it doesn't exist, it gets removed.

    $ printf 'GET / HTTP/1.1\nHost:a.example\n\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 8080
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Link: <http://127.0.0.1/a.example/index.html>; rel="canonical"

  If you mirror a lot of websites within your redbean then you can
  actually tell your browser that redbean is your proxy server, in
  which redbean will act as your private version of the Internet.

    $ printf 'GET http://a.example HTTP/1.0\n\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 8080
    HTTP/1.0 200 OK
    Link: <http://127.0.0.1/a.example/index.html>; rel="canonical"

  If you use a reverse proxy, then redbean recognizes the following
  provided that the proxy forwards requests over the local network:

    X-Forwarded-For: 203.0.113.42:31337
    X-Forwarded-Host: foo.example:80

  There's a text/plain statistics page called /statusz that makes
  it easy to track and monitor the health of your redbean:

    printf 'GET /statusz\n\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 8080

  redbean will display an error page using the /redbean.png logo
  by default, embedded as a bas64 data uri. You can override the
  custom page for various errors by adding files to the zip root.

    zip redbean 404.html      # custom not found page

  Audio video content should not be compressed in your ZIP files.
  Uncompressed assets enable browsers to send Range HTTP request.
  On the other hand compressed assets are best for gzip encoding.

    zip redbean index.html    # adds file
    zip -0 redbean video.mp4  # adds without compression

  You can have redbean run as a daemon by doing the following:

    sudo ./redbean -vvdp80 -p443 -L redbean.log -P redbean.pid
    kill -TERM $(cat redbean.pid) # 1x: graceful shutdown
    kill -TERM $(cat redbean.pid) # 2x: forceful shutdown

  redbean currently has a 32kb limit on request messages and 64kb
  including the payload. redbean will grow to whatever the system
  limits allow. Should fork() or accept() fail redbean will react
  by going into "meltdown mode" which closes lingering workers.
  You can trigger this at any time using:

    kill -USR2 $(cat redbean.pid)

  Another failure condition is running out of disk space in which
  case redbean reacts by truncating the log file. Lastly, redbean
  does the best job possible reporting on resource usage when the
  logger is in debug mode noting that NetBSD is the best at this.

  Your redbean is an actually portable executable, that's able to
  run on six different operating systems. To do that, it needs to
  extract a 4kb loader program to ${TMPDIR:-${HOME:-.}}/.ape that'll
  map your redbean into memory. It does however check to see if `ape`
  is on the system path beforehand. You can also "assimilate" any
  redbean into the platform-local executable format by running:

      $ file redbean
      redbean: DOS/MBR boot sector
      $ ./redbean --assimilate
      $ file redbean
      redbean: ELF 64-bit LSB executable

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECURITY

  redbean uses a protocol polyglot for serving HTTP and HTTPS on
  the same port numbers. For example, both of these are valid:

    http://127.0.0.1:8080/
    https://127.0.0.1:8080/

  SSL verbosity is controlled as follows for troubleshooting:

    -V       log ssl errors
    -VV      log ssl state changes too
    -VVV     log ssl informational messages too
    -VVVV    log ssl verbose details too

  Redbean supports sandboxing flags on Linux and OpenBSD.

    -S (online policy)

      This causes unix.pledge("stdio rpath inet dns") to be called on
      workers after fork() is called. This permits read-only operations
      and APIs like Fetch() that let workers send and receive data with
      private and public Internet hosts. Access to the unix module is
      somewhat restricted, disallowing its more powerful APIs like exec.

    -SS (offline policy)

      This causes unix.pledge("stdio rpath") to be called on workers
      after after fork() is called. This prevents workers from talking
      to the network (other than the client) and allows read-only file
      system access (e.g. `-D DIR` flag).

    -SSS (contained policy)

      This causes unix.pledge("stdio") to be called on workers after
      after fork() is called. This prevents workers from communicating
      with the network (other than the client connection) and prevents
      file system access (with some exceptions like logging). Redbean
      should only be able to serve from its own zip file in this mode.
      Lua script access to the unix module is highly restricted.

  See http://redbean.dev for further details.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
LUA SERVER PAGES

  Any files with the extension .lua will be dynamically served by redbean.
  Here's the simplest possible example:

    Write('<b>Hello World</b>')

  The Lua Server Page above should be able to perform at 700,000 responses
  per second on a Core i9, without any sort of caching. If you want a Lua
  handler that can do 1,000,000 responses per second, then try adding the
  following global handler to your /.init.lua file:

    function OnHttpRequest()
       Write('<b>Hello World</b>')
    end

  Here's an example of a more typical workflow for Lua Server Pages using
  the redbean API:

    SetStatus(200)
    SetHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain; charset=utf-8')
    Write('<p>Hello ')
    Write(EscapeHtml(GetParam('name')))

  We didn't need the first two lines in the previous example, because
  they're implied by redbean automatically if you don't set them. Responses
  are also buffered until the script finishes executing. That enables
  redbean to make HTTP as easy as possible. In the future, API capabilities
  will be expanded to make possible things like websockets.

  redbean embeds the Lua standard library. You can use packages such as io
  to persist and share state across requests and connections, as well as the
  StoreAsset function, and the lsqlite3 module.

  Your Lua interpreter begins its life in the main process at startup in the
  .init.lua, which is likely where you'll want to perform all your expensive
  one-time operations like importing modules. Then, as requests roll in,
  isolated processes are cloned from the blueprint you created.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
REPL

  Your redbean displays a Read-Eval-Print-Loop that lets you modify the
  state of the main server process while your server is running. Any
  changes will propagate into forked clients.

  Your REPL is displayed only when redbean is run as a non-daemon in a
  Unix terminal or the Windows 10 command prompt or PowerShell. Since
  the REPL is a Lua REPL it's not included in a redbean-static builds.

  redbean uses the same keyboard shortcuts as GNU Readline and Emacs.
  Some of its keyboard commands (listed in a previous section) were
  inspired by Paredit.

  A history of your commands is saved to `~/.redbean_history`.

  If you love the redbean repl and want to use it as your language
  interpreter then you can pass the `-i` flag to put redbean into
  interpreter mode.

      redbean -i binarytrees.lua 15

  When the `-i` flag is passed (for interpreter mode), redbean won't
  start a web server and instead functions like the `lua` command. The
  first command line argument becomes the script you want to run. If you
  don't supply a script, then the repl without a web server is
  displayed. This is useful for testing since redbean extensions and
  modules for the Lua language, are still made available. You can also
  write redbean scripts with shebang lines:

      #!/usr/bin/redbean -i
      print('hello world')

  However UNIX operating systems usually require that interpreters be
  encoded in its preferred executable format. You can assimilate your
  redbean into the local format using the following commands:

      $ file redbean
      redbean: DOS/MBR boot sector
      $ ./redbean --assimilate
      $ file redbean
      redbean: ELF 64-bit LSB executable
      $ sudo cp redbean /usr/bin/redbean

  By following the above steps, redbean can be installed systemwide for
  multiple user accounts. It's also possible to chmod the binary to have
  setuid privileges. Please note that, if you do this, the UNIX section
  provides further details on APIs like `unix.setuid` that will help you
  remove root privileges from the process in the appropriate manner.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
LUA ENHANCEMENTS

  We've made some enhancements to the Lua language that should make it
  more comfortable for C/C++ and Python developers. Some of these

    - redbean supports a printf modulus operator, like Python. For
      example, you can say `"hello %s" % {"world"}` instead of
      `string.format("hello %s", "world")`.

      --
      - redbean supports a string multiply operator, like Python. For
      example, you can say `"hi" * 2` instead of `string.rep("hi", 2)`.

      - redbean supports octal (base 8) integer literals. For example
      `0644 == 420` is the case in redbean, whereas in upstream Lua
      `0644 == 644` would be the case.

      - redbean supports binary (base 2) integer literals. For example
      `0b1010 == 10` is the case in redbean, whereas in upstream Lua
      `0b1010` would result in an error.

      - redbean supports the GNU syntax for the ASCII ESC character in
      string literals. For example, `"\e"` is the same as `"\x1b"`.

---
--- For example, if you launch your redbean as follows:
---
---     redbean -v arg1 arg2
---
--- Then your `/.init.lua` file will have the `arg` array like:

---     arg[ 0] = '/zip/.init.lua'
---     arg[ 1] = 'arg1'
---     arg[ 2] = 'arg2'
---
--- If you launch redbean in interpreter mode (rather than web
--- server) mode, then an invocation like this:
---
---     ./redbean -i script.lua arg1 arg2
---
--- Would have an `arg` array like this:
---
---     arg[-1] = './redbean'
---     arg[ 0] = 'script.lua'
---     arg[ 1] = 'arg1'
---     arg[ 2] = 'arg2'
---@type string[]

SPECIAL PATHS

/
        redbean will generate a zip central directory listing for this
        page, and this page only, but only if there isn't an /index.lua or
        /index.html file defined.

/.init.lua
        This script is run once in the main process at startup. This lets
        you modify the state of the Lua interpreter before connection
        processes are forked off. For example, it's a good idea to do
        expensive one-time computations here. You can also use this file
        to call the ProgramFOO() functions below. The init module load
        happens after redbean's arguments and zip assets have been parsed,
        but before calling functions like socket() and fork(). Note that
        this path is a hidden file so that it can't be unintentionally run
        by the network client.

/.reload.lua (deprecated; use OnServerReload instead)
        This script is run from the main process when SIGHUP is received.
        This only applies to redbean when running in daemon mode. Any
        changes that are made to the Lua interpreter state will be
        inherited by future forked connection processes. Note that this
        path is a hidden file so that it can't be unintentionally run by
        the network client.

/.lua/...
        Your Lua modules go in this directory. The way it works is redbean
        sets Lua's package.path to /zip/.lua/?.lua;/zip/.lua/?/init.lua by
        default. Cosmopolitan Libc lets system calls like open read from
        the ZIP structure, if the filename is prefixed with /zip/. So this
        works like magic.

/redbean.png
        If it exists, it'll be used as the / listing page icon, embedded
        as a base64 URI.

/usr/share/zoneinfo
        This directory contains a subset of the timezone database.
        Your `TZ` environment variable controls which one of these
        files is used by functions such as unix.localtime().

/usr/share/ssl/root
        This directory contains your root certificate authorities. It is
        needed so the Fetch() HTTPS client API can verify that a remote
        certificate was signed by a third party. You can add your own
        certificate files to this directory within the ZIP executable.
        If you enable HTTPS client verification then redbean will check
        that HTTPS clients (a) have a certificate and (b) it was signed.

/.args
        Specifies default command-line arguments.

        There's one argument per line. Trailing newline is ignored. If
        the special argument `...` is *not* encountered, then the
        replacement will only happen if *no* CLI args are specified.
        If the special argument `...` *is* encountered, then it'll be
        replaced with whatever CLI args were specified by the user.

        For example, you might want to use redbean in interpreter
        mode, where your script file is inside the zip. Then, if your
        redbean is run, what you want is to have the default behavior
        be running your script. In that case, you might:

            $ cat <<'EOF' >.args
            -i
            /zip/hello.lua
            EOF

            $ cat <<'EOF' >hello.lua
            print("hello world")
            EOF

            $ zip redbean .args hello.lua
            $ ./redbean
            hello world

        Please note that if you ran:

            $ ./redbean -vv

        Then the default mode of redbean will kick back in. To prevent
        that from happening, simply add the magic arg `...` to the end
        of your `.args` file.

-- FUNCTIONS

--- Appends data to HTTP response payload buffer.
---
--- This is buffered independently of headers.
---
---@param data string
function Write(data) end

--- Starts an HTTP response, specifying the parameters on its first line.
---
--- This method will reset the response and is therefore mutually
--- exclusive with `ServeAsset` and other `Serve*` functions. If a
--- status setting function isn't called, then the default behavior is
--- to send `200 OK`.
---
---@param code integer
---@param reason? string is optional since redbean can fill in the appropriate text for well-known magic numbers, e.g. `200`, `404`, etc.
function SetStatus(code, reason) end

--- Appends HTTP header to response header buffer.
---
--- Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed automatically. Overlong
--- characters are canonicalized. C0 and C1 control codes are forbidden,
--- with the exception of tab. This function automatically calls
--- `SetStatus(200, "OK")` if a status has not yet been set. As
--- `SetStatus` and `Serve*` functions reset the response, `SetHeader`
--- needs to be called after `SetStatus` and `Serve*` functions are
--- called. The header buffer is independent of the payload buffer.
--- Neither is written to the wire until the Lua Server Page has
--- finished executing. This function disallows the setting of certain
--- headers such as and Content-Range which are abstracted by the
--- transport layer. In such cases, consider calling `ServeAsset`.
---
---@param name string is case-insensitive and restricted to non-space ASCII
---@param value string is a UTF-8 string that must be encodable as ISO-8859-1.
function SetHeader(name, value) end

--- Appends Set-Cookie HTTP header to the response header buffer.
---
--- Several Set-Cookie headers can be added to the same response.
--- `__Host-` and `__Secure-` prefixes are supported and may set or
--- overwrite some of the options (for example, specifying `__Host-`
--- prefix sets the Secure option to `true`, sets the path to `"/"`, and
--- removes the Domain option). The following options can be used (their
--- lowercase equivalents are supported as well):
---
--- - `Expires` sets the maximum lifetime of the cookie as an HTTP-date timestamp. Can be specified as a Date in the RFC1123 (string) format or as a UNIX timestamp (number of seconds).
--- - `MaxAge` sets number of seconds until the cookie expires. A zero or negative number will expire the cookie immediately. If both Expires and MaxAge are set, MaxAge has precedence.
--- - `Domain` sets the host to which the cookie will be sent.
--- - `Path` sets the path that must be present in the request URL, or the client will not send the Cookie header.
--- - `Secure` (boolean) requests the cookie to be only send to the server when a request is made with the https: scheme.
--- - `HttpOnly` (boolean) forbids JavaScript from accessing the cookie.
--- - `SameSite` (Strict, Lax, or None) controls whether a cookie is sent with cross-origin requests, providing some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks.
---
---@param name string
---@param value string
---@param options { Expires: string|integer?, MaxAge: integer?, Domain: string?, Path: string?, Secure: boolean?, HttpOnly: boolean?, SameSite: "Strict"|"Lax"|"None"? }?
function SetCookie(name, value, options) end

--- Returns first value associated with name. name is handled in a case-sensitive manner. This function checks Request-URL parameters first. Then it checks `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` from the message body, if it exists, which is common for HTML forms sending `POST` requests. If a parameter is supplied matching name that has no value, e.g. `foo` in `?foo&bar=value`, then the returned value will be `nil`, whereas for `?foo=&bar=value` it would be `""`. To differentiate between no-equal and absent, use the `HasParam` function. The returned value is decoded from ISO-8859-1 (only in the case of Request-URL) and we assume that percent-encoded characters were supplied by the client as UTF-8 sequences, which are returned exactly as the client supplied them, and may therefore may contain overlong sequences, control codes, `NUL` characters, and even numbers which have been banned by the IETF. It is the responsibility of the caller to impose further restrictions on validity, if they're desired.
---@param name string
---@return string value
---@nodiscard
function GetParam(name) end

--- Escapes HTML entities: The set of entities is `&><"'` which become `&amp;&gt;&lt;&quot;&#39;`. This function is charset agnostic and will not canonicalize overlong encodings. It is assumed that a UTF-8 string will be supplied. See `escapehtml.c`.

--- Turns JSON string into a Lua data structure.
---
--- This is a generally permissive parser, in the sense that like
--- v8, it permits scalars as top-level values. Therefore we must
--- note that this API can be thought of as special, in the sense
---
---     val = assert(DecodeJson(str))
---
--- will usually do the right thing, except in cases where `false`
--- or `null` are the top-level value. In those cases, it's needed
--- to check the second value too in order to discern from error
---
---     val, err = DecodeJson(str)
---     if not val then
---        if err then
---           print('bad json', err)
---        elseif val == nil then
---           print('val is null')
---        elseif val == false then
---           print('val is false')
---        end
---     end
---
--- This parser supports 64-bit signed integers. If an overflow
--- happens, then the integer is silently coerced to double, as
--- consistent with v8. If a double overflows into `Infinity`, we
--- coerce it to `null` since that's what v8 does, and the same
--- goes for underflows which, like v8, are coerced to `0.0`.
---
--- When objects are parsed, your Lua object can't preserve the
--- original ordering of fields. As such, they'll be sorted by
--- `EncodeJson()` and may not round-trip with original intent.
---
--- This parser has perfect conformance with JSONTestSuite.
---
--- This parser validates utf-8 and utf-16.

function DecodeJson(input) end

--- Turns Lua data structure into JSON string.
---
--- Since Lua uses tables are both hashmaps and arrays, we use a
--- simple fast algorithm for telling the two apart. Tables with
--- non-zero length (as reported by `#`) are encoded as arrays,
--- and any non-array elements are ignored. For example:
---
---     >: EncodeJson({2})
---     "[2]"
---     >: EncodeJson({[1]=2, ["hi"]=1})
---     "[2]"
---
--- If there are holes in your array, then the serialized array
--- will exclude everything after the first hole. If the beginning
--- of your array is a hole, then an error is returned.
---
---     >: EncodeJson({[1]=1, [3]=3})
---     "[1]"
---     >: EncodeJson({[2]=1, [3]=3})
---     "[]"
---     >: EncodeJson({[2]=1, [3]=3})
---     nil     "json objects must only use string keys"
---
--- If the raw length of a table is reported as zero, then we
--- check for the magic element `[0]=false`. If it's present, then
--- your table will be serialized as empty array `[]`. An entry is
--- inserted by `DecodeJson()` automatically, only when encountering
--- empty arrays, and it's necessary in order to make empty arrays
--- round-trip. If raw length is zero and `[0]=false` is absent,
--- then your table will be serialized as an iterated object.
---
---     >: EncodeJson({})
---     "{}"
---     >: EncodeJson({[0]=false})

--- - `indent`: `(str=" ")` This option controls the indentation of pretty
---    formatting. This field is ignored if pretty isn't `true`.
--- - `maxdepth`: `(int=64)` This option controls the maximum amount of recursion

---
--- If a user data object has a `__repr` or `__tostring` meta method, then that'll
--- be used to encode the Lua code.
---
--- This serializer is designed primarily to describe data. For example, it's used
--- by the REPL where we need to be able to ignore errors when displaying data
--- structures, since showing most things imperfectly is better than crashing.
--- Therefore this isn't the kind of serializer you'd want to use to persist data
--- in prod. Try using the JSON serializer for that purpose.
---
--- Non-encodable value types (e.g. threads, functions) will be represented as a
--- string literal with the type name and pointer address. The string description
--- is of an unspecified format that could most likely change. This encoder detects
--- cyclic tables; however instead of failing, it embeds a string of unspecified
--- layout describing the cycle.
---
--- Integer literals are encoded as decimal. However if the int64 number is ≥256
--- and has a population count of 1 then we switch to representating the number in
--- hexadecimal, for readability. Hex numbers have leading zeroes added in order
--- to visualize whether the number fits in a uint16, uint32, or int64. Also some
--- numbers can only be encoded expressionally. For example, `NaN`s are serialized
--- as `0/0`, and `Infinity` is `math.huge`.

--- Enables DDOS protection.
---
--- Imagine you have 2**32 buckets, one for each IP address. Each bucket
--- can hold about 127 tokens. Every second a background worker puts one
--- token in each bucket. When a TCP client socket is opened, it takes a
--- token from its bucket, and then proceeds. If the bucket holds only a
--- third of its original tokens, then redbean sends them a 429 warning.
--- If the client ignores this warning and keeps sending requests, until
--- there's no tokens left, then the banhammer finally comes down.
---
---    function OnServerStart()
---        ProgramTokenBucket()
---        ProgramTrustedIp(ParseIp('x.x.x.x'), 32)
---        assert(unix.setrlimit(unix.RLIMIT_NPROC, 1000, 1000))
---    end
---
--- This model of network rate limiting generously lets people "burst" a
--- tiny bit. For example someone might get a strong craving for content
--- and smash the reload button in Chrome 64 times in a fow seconds. But
--- since the client only get 1 new token per second, they'd better cool
--- their heels for a few minutes after doing that. This amount of burst
--- can be altered by choosing the `reject` / `ignore` / `ban` threshold
--- arguments. For example, if the `reject` parameter is set to 126 then
--- no bursting is allowed, which probably isn't a good idea.
---
--- redbean is programmed to acquire a token immediately after accept()
--- is called from the main server process, which is well before fork()
--- or read() or any Lua code happens. redbean then takes action, based
--- on the token count, which can be accept / reject / ignore / ban. If
--- redbean determines a ban is warrented, then 4-byte datagram is sent
--- to the unix domain socket `/var/run/blackhole.sock` which should be
--- operated using the blackholed program we distribute separately.
---
--- The trick redbean uses on Linux for example is insert rules in your
--- raw prerouting table. redbean is very fast at the application layer
--- so the biggest issue we've encountered in production is are kernels
--- themselves, and programming the raw prerouting table dynamically is
--- how we solved that.
---
--- `replenish` is the number of times per second a token should be
--- added to each bucket. The default value is 1 which means one token
--- is granted per second to all buckets. The minimum value is 1/3600
--- which means once per hour. The maximum value for this setting is
--- 1e6, which means once every microsecond.
---
--- `cidr` is the specificity of judgement.  Since creating 2^32 buckets
--- would need 4GB of RAM, redbean defaults this value to 24 which means
--- filtering applies to class c network blocks (i.e. x.x.x.*), and your
--- token buckets only take up 2^24 bytes of RAM (16MB). This can be set
--- to any number on the inclusive interval [8,32], where having a lower
--- number means you use less ram/cpu, but splash damage applies more to
--- your clients; whereas higher numbers means more ram/cpu usage, while
--- ensuring rate limiting only applies to specific compromised actors.
---
--- `reject` is the token count or treshold at which redbean should send
--- 429 Too Many Request warnings to the client. Permitted values can be
--- anywhere between -1 and 126 inclusively. The default value is 30 and
--- -1 means disable to disable (assuming AcquireToken() will be used).
---
--- `ignore` is the token count or treshold, at which redbean should try
--- simply ignoring clients and close the connection without logging any
--- kind of warning, and without sending any response. The default value
--- for this setting is `MIN(reject / 2, 15)`. This must be less than or
--- equal to the `reject` setting. Allowed values are [-1,126] where you
--- can use -1 as a means of disabling `ignore`.
---
--- `ban` is the token count at which redbean should report IP addresses
--- to the blackhole daemon via a unix-domain socket datagram so they'll
--- get banned in the kernel routing tables. redbean's default value for
--- this setting is `MIN(ignore / 10, 1)`. Permitted values are [-1,126]
--- where -1 may be used as a means of disabling the `ban` feature.
---
--- This function throws an exception if the constraints described above
--- are not the case. Warnings are logged should redbean fail to connect
--- to the blackhole daemon, assuming it hasn't been disabled. It's safe
--- to use load balancing tools when banning is enabled, since you can't
--- accidentally ban your own network interface addresses, loopback ips,
--- or ProgramTrustedIp() addresses where these rate limits don't apply.
---
--- It's assumed will be called from the .init.lua global scope although

    ---
    --- For example, if process A is in the middle of a large write transaction

--- Compiles and executes the SQL statement(s) given in string sql. The statements
--- are simply executed one after the other and not stored. The function returns
--- `lsqlite3.OK` on success or else a numerical error code.
---
--- If one or more of the SQL statements are queries, then the callback function
--- specified in func is invoked once for each row of the query result (if func is
--- `nil`, no callback is invoked).
---
--- The callback receives four arguments:
--- -  `udata (the third parameter of the db:exec() call),
--- - the number of columns in the row
--- - a table with the column values
--- - another table with the column names.
---
--- The callback function should return `0`. If the callback returns a non-zero
--- value then the query is aborted, all subsequent SQL statements are skipped
--- and `db:exec()` returns `lsqlite3.ABORT`. Here is a simple example:
---
---     sql=[=[

---     -- .init.lua
---     maxmind = require 'maxmind'
---     asndb = maxmind.open('/usr/local/share/maxmind/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb')

---         Write(' ')
---         Write(EscapeHtml(asorg))
---     end
---
--- The database file is distributed by MaxMind. You need to sign up on their

--- This is an experimental module that, like the maxmind module, gives you insight

---

---
--- - `E`: End of Option list

--- This module implements a password hashing algorithm based on blake2b that won
--- the Password Hashing Competition.
---
--- It can be used to securely store user passwords in your SQLite database, in a
--- way that destroys the password, but can be verified by regenerating the hash
--- again the next time the user logs in. Destroying the password is important,
--- since if your database is compromised, the bad guys won't be able to use
--- rainbow tables to recover the plain text of the passwords.
---
--- Argon2 achieves this security by being expensive to compute. Care should be
--- taken in choosing parameters, since an HTTP endpoint that uses Argon2 can just
--- as easily become a denial of service vector. For example, you may want to
--- consider throttling your login endpoint.

---
--- Returns a file descriptor integer that needs to be closed, e.g.
---
---     fd = assert(unix.open("/etc/passwd", unix.O_RDONLY))
---     print(unix.read(fd))
---     unix.close(fd)
---
--- `flags` should have one of:
---
--- - `O_RDONLY`:     open for reading (default)
--- - `O_WRONLY`:     open for writing
--- - `O_RDWR`:       open for reading and writing
---
--- The following values may also be OR'd into `flags`:
---
---  - `O_CREAT`      create file if it doesn't exist
---  - `O_TRUNC`      automatic ftruncate(fd,0) if exists
---  - `O_CLOEXEC`    automatic close() upon execve()
---  - `O_EXCL`       exclusive access (see below)
---  - `O_APPEND`     open file for append only
---  - `O_NONBLOCK`   asks read/write to fail with EAGAIN rather than block
---  - `O_DIRECT`     it's complicated (not supported on Apple and OpenBSD)
---  - `O_DIRECTORY`  useful for stat'ing (hint on UNIX but required on NT)
---  - `O_TMPFILE`    try to make temp more secure (Linux and Windows only)
---  - `O_NOFOLLOW`   fail if it's a symlink (zero on Windows)
---  - `O_DSYNC`      it's complicated (zero on non-Linux/Apple)
---  - `O_RSYNC`      it's complicated (zero on non-Linux/Apple)
---  - `O_PATH`       it's complicated (zero on non-Linux)
---  - `O_VERIFY`     it's complicated (zero on non-FreeBSD)
---  - `O_SHLOCK`     it's complicated (zero on non-BSD)
---  - `O_EXLOCK`     it's complicated (zero on non-BSD)
---  - `O_NOATIME`    don't record access time (zero on non-Linux)
---  - `O_RANDOM`     hint random access intent (zero on non-Windows)
---  - `O_SEQUENTIAL` hint sequential access intent (zero on non-Windows)
---  - `O_COMPRESSED` ask fs to abstract compression (zero on non-Windows)
---  - `O_INDEXED`    turns on that slow performance (zero on non-Windows)
---
---  There are three regular combinations for the above flags:
---
---  - `O_RDONLY`: Opens existing file for reading. If it doesn't exist
---    then nil is returned and errno will be `ENOENT` (or in some other
---    cases `ENOTDIR`).
---
---  - `O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC`: Creates file. If it already exists,
---    then the existing copy is destroyed and the opened file will
---    start off with a length of zero. This is the behavior of the
---    traditional creat() system call.
---
---  - `O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL`: Create file only if doesn't exist
---    already. If it does exist then `nil` is returned along with
---    `errno` set to `EEXIST`.
---
--- `dirfd` defaults to to `unix.AT_FDCWD` and may optionally be set to
--- a directory file descriptor to which `path` is relative.
---
--- Returns `ENOENT` if `path` doesn't exist.
---
--- Returns `ENOTDIR` if `path` contained a directory component that
--- wasn't a directory
---.

--- Closes file descriptor.
---
--- This function should never be called twice for the same file
--- descriptor, regardless of whether or not an error happened. The file
--- descriptor is always gone after close is called. So it technically
--- always succeeds, but that doesn't mean an error should be ignored.
--- For example, on NFS a close failure could indicate data loss.
---
--- Closing does not mean that scheduled i/o operations have been
--- completed. You'd need to use fsync() or fdatasync() beforehand to
--- ensure that. You shouldn't need to do that normally, because our
--- close implementation guarantees a consistent view, since on systems
--- where it isn't guaranteed (like Windows) close will implicitly sync.
---
--- File descriptors are automatically closed on exit().
---
--- Returns `EBADF` if `fd` wasn't valid.
---
--- Returns `EINTR` possibly maybe.

--- Returns raw environment variables.
---
--- This allocates and constructs the C/C++ `environ` variable as a Lua
--- table consisting of string keys and string values.
---
--- This data structure preserves casing. On Windows NT, by convention,
--- environment variable keys are treated in a case-insensitive way. It
--- is the responsibility of the caller to consider this.
---
--- This data structure preserves valueless variables. It's possible on
--- both UNIX and Windows to have an environment variable without an
--- equals, even though it's unusual.
---
--- This data structure preserves duplicates. For example, on Windows,
--- there's some irregular uses of environment variables such as how the
--- command prompt inserts multiple environment variables with empty
--- string as keys, for its internal bookkeeping.

function unix.environ() end

--- Creates a new process mitosis style.
---
--- This system call returns twice. The parent process gets the nonzero
--- pid. The child gets zero.
---
--- Here's a simple usage example of creating subprocesses, where we
--- fork off a child worker from a main process hook callback to do some
--- independent chores, such as sending an HTTP request back to redbean.
---
---    -- as soon as server starts, make a fetch to the server
---    -- then signal redbean to shutdown when fetch is complete
---    local onServerStart = function()
---       if assert(unix.fork()) == 0 then
---          local ok, headers, body = Fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8080/test')
---          unix.kill(unix.getppid(), unix.SIGTERM)
---          unix.exit(0)
---       end
---    end
---    OnServerStart = onServerStart
---
--- We didn't need to use `wait()` here, because (a) we want redbean to go
--- back to what it was doing before as the `Fetch()` completes, and (b)
--- redbean's main process already has a zombie collector. However it's
--- a moot point, since once the fetch is done, the child process then
--- asks redbean to gracefully shutdown by sending SIGTERM its parent.
---
--- This is actually a situation where we *must* use fork, because the
--- purpose of the main redbean process is to call accept() and create
--- workers. So if we programmed redbean to use the main process to send
--- a blocking request to itself instead, then redbean would deadlock
--- and never be able to accept() the client.
---
--- While deadlocking is an extreme example, the truth is that latency
--- issues can crop up for the same reason that just cause jitter
--- instead, and as such, can easily go unnoticed. For example, if you
--- do soemething that takes longer than a few milliseconds from inside
--- your redbean heartbeat, then that's a few milliseconds in which
--- redbean is no longer concurrent, and tail latency is being added to
--- its ability to accept new connections. fork() does a great job at
--- solving this.
---
--- If you're not sure how long something will take, then when in doubt,
--- fork off a process. You can then report its completion to something
--- like SQLite. Redbean makes having lots of processes cheap. On Linux
--- they're about as lightweight as what heavyweight environments call
--- greenlets. You can easily have 10,000 Redbean workers on one PC.
---
--- Here's some benchmarks for fork() performance across platforms:
---
---    Linux 5.4 fork      l:     97,200𝑐    31,395𝑛𝑠  [metal]
---    FreeBSD 12 fork     l:    236,089𝑐    78,841𝑛𝑠  [vmware]
---    Darwin 20.6 fork    l:    295,325𝑐    81,738𝑛𝑠  [metal]
---    NetBSD 9 fork       l:  5,832,027𝑐 1,947,899𝑛𝑠  [vmware]
---    OpenBSD 6.8 fork    l: 13,241,940𝑐 4,422,103𝑛𝑠  [vmware]
---    Windows10 fork      l: 18,802,239𝑐 6,360,271𝑛𝑠  [metal]
---
--- One of the benefits of using `fork()` is it creates an isolation
--- barrier between the different parts of your app. This can lead to
--- enhanced reliability and security. For example, redbean uses fork so
--- it can wipe your ssl keys from memory before handing over control to
--- request handlers that process untrusted input. It also ensures that
--- if your Lua app crashes, it won't take down the server as a whole.
--- Hence it should come as no surprise that `fork()` would go slower on
--- operating systems that have more security features. So depending on
--- your use case, you can choose the operating system that suits you.

---
--- `prog` needs to be the resolved pathname of your executable. You

---
--- `args` is a string list table. The first element in `args`
--- should be `prog`. Values are coerced to strings. This parameter
--- defaults to `{prog}`.
---
--- `env` is a string list table. Values are coerced to strings. No
--- ordering requirement is imposed. By convention, each string has its

--- variable which is inherited from the shell that launched redbean.
--- It's the responsibility of the user to supply a sanitized environ
--- when spawning untrusted processes.
---
--- `execve()` is normally called after `fork()` returns `0`. If that isn't

--- Duplicates file descriptor.
---

---
--- `flags` can have `O_CLOEXEC` which means the returned file

---
--- `lowest` defaults to zero and defines the lowest numbered file
--- descriptor that's acceptable to use. If `newfd` is specified then
--- `lowest` is ignored. For example, if you wanted to duplicate
--- standard input, then:
---
---     stdin2 = assert(unix.dup(0, nil, unix.O_CLOEXEC, 3))

---
--- `mask` is a unix.Sigset() object (see section below).

---
--- - Lua function
--- - `unix.SIG_IGN`
--- - `unix.SIG_DFL`
---
---@param flags? integer can have:
---
--- - `unix.SA_RESTART`: Enables BSD signal handling semantics. Normally
--- i/o entrypoints check for pending signals to deliver. If one gets
--- delivered during an i/o call, the normal behavior is to cancel the
--- i/o operation and return -1 with `EINTR` in errno. If you use the
--- `SA_RESTART` flag then that behavior changes, so that any function
--- that's been annotated with @restartable will not return `EINTR`
--- and will instead resume the i/o operation. This makes coding
--- easier but it can be an anti-pattern if not used carefully, since
--- poor usage can easily result in latency issues. It also requires
--- one to do more work in signal handlers, so special care needs to
--- be given to which C library functions are @asyncsignalsafe.
---
--- - `unix.SA_RESETHAND`: Causes signal handler to be single-shot. This
--- means that, upon entry of delivery to a signal handler, it's reset
--- to the `SIG_DFL` handler automatically. You may use the alias
--- `SA_ONESHOT` for this flag, which means the same thing.
---
--- - `unix.SA_NODEFER`: Disables the reentrancy safety check on your signal
--- handler. Normally that's a good thing, since for instance if your
--- `SIGSEGV` signal handler happens to segfault, you're going to want
--- your process to just crash rather than looping endlessly. But in
--- some cases it's desirable to use `SA_NODEFER` instead, such as at
--- times when you wish to `longjmp()` out of your signal handler and
--- back into your program. This is only safe to do across platforms
--- for non-crashing signals such as `SIGCHLD` and `SIGINT`. Crash
--- handlers should use Xed instead to recover execution, because on
--- Windows a `SIGSEGV` or `SIGTRAP` crash handler might happen on a
--- separate stack and/or a separate thread. You may use the alias
--- `SA_NOMASK` for this flag, which means the same thing.
---
--- - `unix.SA_NOCLDWAIT`: Changes `SIGCHLD` so the zombie is gone and
--- you can't call wait() anymore; similar but may still deliver the
--- SIGCHLD.
---
--- - `unix.SA_NOCLDSTOP`: Lets you set `SIGCHLD` handler that's only
--- notified on exit/termination and not notified on `SIGSTOP`,
--- `SIGTSTP`, `SIGTTIN`, `SIGTTOU`, or `SIGCONT`.
---
--- Example:
---
---     function OnSigUsr1(sig)
---         gotsigusr1 = true
---     end
---     gotsigusr1 = false
---     oldmask = assert(unix.sigprocmask(unix.SIG_BLOCK, unix.Sigset(unix.SIGUSR1)))
---     assert(unix.sigaction(unix.SIGUSR1, OnSigUsr1))
---     assert(unix.raise(unix.SIGUSR1))
---     assert(not gotsigusr1)
---     ok, err = unix.sigsuspend(oldmask)
---     assert(not ok)
---     assert(err:errno() == unix.EINTR)
---     assert(gotsigusr1)
---     assert(unix.sigprocmask(unix.SIG_SETMASK, oldmask))
---

--- will work on all platforms. It's emulated on XNU and Windows which
--- means it won't propagate across execve() currently.
---
--- - `RLIMIT_CPU` causes `SIGXCPU` to be sent to the process when the
--- soft limit on CPU time is exceeded, and the process is destroyed
--- when the hard limit is exceeded. It works everywhere but Windows
--- where it should be possible to poll getrusage() with setitimer().
---
--- - `RLIMIT_FSIZE` causes `SIGXFSZ` to sent to the process when the
--- soft limit on file size is exceeded and the process is destroyed
--- when the hard limit is exceeded. It works everywhere but Windows.
---
--- - `RLIMIT_NPROC` limits the number of simultaneous processes and it
--- should work on all platforms except Windows. Please be advised it
--- limits the process, with respect to the activities of the user id
--- as a whole.
---
--- - `RLIMIT_NOFILE` limits the number of open file descriptors and it
--- should work on all platforms except Windows (TODO).
---
--- If a limit isn't supported by the host platform, it'll be set to
--- 127. On most platforms these limits are enforced by the kernel and
--- as such are inherited by subprocesses.

--- Restrict system operations.
---
--- This can be used to sandbox your redbean workers. It allows finer
--- customization compared to the `-S` flag.
---
--- Pledging causes most system calls to become unavailable. On Linux the
--- disabled calls will return EPERM whereas OpenBSD kills the process.
---
--- Using pledge is irreversible. On Linux it causes PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS
--- to be set on your process.
---
--- By default exit and exit_group are always allowed. This is useful
--- for processes that perform pure computation and interface with the
--- parent via shared memory.
---
--- Once pledge is in effect, the chmod functions (if allowed) will not
--- permit the sticky/setuid/setgid bits to change. Linux will EPERM here
--- and OpenBSD should ignore those three bits rather than crashing.
---
--- User and group IDs also can't be changed once pledge is in effect.
--- OpenBSD should ignore the chown functions without crashing. Linux
--- will just EPERM.
---
--- Memory functions won't permit creating executable code after pledge.
--- Restrictions on origin of SYSCALL instructions will become enforced
--- on Linux (cf. msyscall) after pledge too, which means the process
--- gets killed if SYSCALL is used outside the .privileged section. One
--- exception is if the "exec" group is specified, in which case these
--- restrictions need to be loosened.

---
--- ### settime

---
--- ### unveil
---
--- Allows unveil().
---
--- ### exec
---
--- Allows execve.
---
--- If the executable in question needs a loader, then you will need
--- "rpath prot_exec" too. With APE, security is strongest when you
--- assimilate your binaries beforehand, using the --assimilate flag,
--- or the o//tool/build/assimilate program. On OpenBSD this is
--- mandatory.
---
--- ### prot_exec
---
--- Allows mmap(PROT_EXEC) and mprotect(PROT_EXEC).
---
--- This may be needed to launch non-static non-native executables,
--- such as non-assimilated APE binaries, or programs that link
--- dynamic shared objects, i.e. most Linux distro binaries.
---
---@param execpromises? string only matters if "exec" is specified in `promises`.
--- In that case, this specifies the promises that'll apply once `execve()`
--- happens. If this is `NULL` then the default is used, which is
--- unrestricted. OpenBSD allows child processes to escape the sandbox
--- (so a pledged OpenSSH server process can do things like spawn a root
--- shell). Linux however requires monotonically decreasing privileges.
--- This function will will perform some validation on Linux to make
--- sure that `execpromises` is a subset of `promises`. Your libc
--- wrapper for `execve()` will then apply its SECCOMP BPF filter later.
--- Since Linux has to do this before calling `sys_execve()`, the executed
--- process will be weakened to have execute permissions too.
---
---@param mode integer? if specified should specify one penalty:
---
--- - `unix.PLEDGE_PENALTY_KILL_THREAD` causes the violating thread to
---   be killed. This is the default on Linux. It's effectively the
---   same as killing the process, since redbean has no threads. The
---   termination signal can't be caught and will be either `SIGSYS`
---   or `SIGABRT`. Consider enabling stderr logging below so you'll
---   know why your program failed. Otherwise check the system log.
---
--- - `unix.PLEDGE_PENALTY_KILL_PROCESS` causes the process and all
---   its threads to be killed. This is always the case on OpenBSD.
---
--- - `unix.PLEDGE_PENALTY_RETURN_EPERM` causes system calls to just
---   return an `EPERM` error instead of killing. This is a gentler
---   solution that allows code to display a friendly warning. Please
---   note this may lead to weird behaviors if the software being
---   sandboxed is lazy about checking error results.
---
--- `mode` may optionally bitwise or the following flags:
---
--- - `unix.PLEDGE_STDERR_LOGGING` enables friendly error message
---   logging letting you know which promises are needed whenever
---   violations occur. Without this, violations will be logged to
---   `dmesg` on Linux if the penalty is to kill the process. You
---   would then need to manually look up the system call number and
---   then cross reference it with the cosmopolitan libc pledge()
---   documentation. You can also use `strace -ff` which is easier.
---   This is ignored OpenBSD, which already has a good system log.
---   Turning on stderr logging (which uses SECCOMP trapping) also
---   means that the `unix.WTERMSIG()` on your killed processes will
---   always be `unix.SIGABRT` on both Linux and OpenBSD. Otherwise,
---   Linux prefers to raise `unix.SIGSYS`.
---@return true
---@overload fun(promises?: string, execpromises?: string, mode?: integer): nil, error: unix.Errno
function unix.pledge(promises, execpromises, mode) end

--- Restricts filesystem operations, e.g.
---
---    unix.unveil(".", "r");     -- current dir + children visible
---    unix.unveil("/etc", "r");  -- make /etc readable too
---    unix.unveil(nil, nil);     -- commit and lock policy
---
--- Unveiling restricts a thread's view of the filesystem to a set of
--- allowed paths with specific privileges.
---
--- Once you start using unveil(), the entire file system is considered
--- hidden. You then specify, by repeatedly calling unveil(), which paths
--- should become unhidden. When you're finished, you call `unveil(nil,nil)`
--- which commits your policy, after which further use is forbidden, in
--- the current thread, as well as any threads or processes it spawns.
---
--- There are some differences between unveil() on Linux versus OpenBSD.
---
--- 1. Build your policy and lock it in one go. On OpenBSD, policies take
---  effect immediately and may evolve as you continue to call unveil()
---  but only in a more restrictive direction. On Linux, nothing will
---  happen until you call `unveil(nil,nil)` which commits and locks.
---
--- 2. Try not to overlap directory trees. On OpenBSD, if directory trees
---  overlap, then the most restrictive policy will be used for a given
---  file. On Linux overlapping may result in a less restrictive policy
---  and possibly even undefined behavior.
---
--- 3. OpenBSD and Linux disagree on error codes. On OpenBSD, accessing
---  paths outside of the allowed set raises ENOENT, and accessing ones
---  with incorrect permissions raises EACCES. On Linux, both these
---  cases raise EACCES.
---
--- 4. Unlike OpenBSD, Linux does nothing to conceal the existence of
---  paths. Even with an unveil() policy in place, it's still possible
---  to access the metadata of all files using functions like stat()
---  and open(O_PATH), provided you know the path. A sandboxed process
---  can always, for example, determine how many bytes of data are in
---  /etc/passwd, even if the file isn't readable. But it's still not
---  possible to use opendir() and go fishing for paths which weren't
---  previously known.
---
--- This system call is supported natively on OpenBSD and polyfilled on
--- Linux using the Landlock LSM[1].

--- Relinquishes scheduled quantum.

--- Creates interprocess shared memory mapping.
---
--- This function allocates special memory that'll be inherited across
--- fork in a shared way. By default all memory in Redbean is "private"
--- memory that's only viewable and editable to the process that owns
--- it. When unix.fork() happens, memory is copied appropriately so
--- that changes to memory made in the child process, don't clobber
--- the memory at those same addresses in the parent process. If you
--- don't want that to happen, and you want the memory to be shared
--- similar to how it would be shared if you were using threads, then
--- you can use this function to achieve just that.
---
--- The memory object this function returns may be accessed using its
--- methods, which support atomics and futexes. It's very low-level.
--- For example, you can use it to implement scalable mutexes:
---
---     mem = unix.mapshared(8000 * 8)
---
---     LOCK = 0 -- pick an arbitrary word index for lock
---
---     -- From Futexes Are Tricky Version 1.1 § Mutex, Take 3;
---     -- Ulrich Drepper, Red Hat Incorporated, June 27, 2004.
---     function Lock()

---         if not ok then
---             if old == 1 then
---                 old = mem:xchg(LOCK, 2)
---             end
---             while old > 0 do
---                 mem:wait(LOCK, 2)
---                 old = mem:xchg(LOCK, 2)
---             end
---         end
---     end
---     function Unlock()
---         old = mem:add(LOCK, -1)
---         if old == 2 then
---             mem:store(LOCK, 0)
---             mem:wake(LOCK, 1)
---         end
---     end
---
--- It's possible to accomplish the same thing as unix.mapshared()
--- using files and unix.fcntl() advisory locks. However this goes
--- significantly faster. For example, that's what SQLite does and
--- we recommend using SQLite for IPC in redbean. But, if your app
--- has thousands of forked processes fighting for a file lock you
--- might need something lower level than file locks, to implement
--- things like throttling. Shared memory is a good way to do that
--- since there's nothing that's faster.
---
---@param size integer
--- The `size` parameter needs to be a multiple of 8. The returned
--- memory is zero initialized. When allocating shared memory, you
--- should try to get as much use out of it as possible, since the
--- overhead of allocating a single shared mapping is 500 words of
--- resident memory and 8000 words of virtual memory. It's because
--- the Cosmopolitan Libc mmap() granularity is 2**16.

--- This method asks the kernel to suspend the process until either the
--- absolute deadline expires or we're woken up by another process that
--- calls `unix.Memory:wake()`.
---
--- The `expect` parameter is used only upon entry to synchronize the
--- transition to kernelspace. The kernel doesn't actually poll the
--- memory location. It uses `expect` to make sure the process doesn't
--- get added to the wait list unless it's sure that it needs to wait,
--- since the kernel can only control the ordering of wait / wake calls
--- across processes.
---
--- The default behavior is to wait until the heat death of the universe
--- if necessary. You may alternatively specify an absolute deadline. If
--- it's less than or equal to the value returned by clock_gettime, then
--- this routine is non-blocking. Otherwise we'll block at most until
--- the current time reaches the absolute deadline.
---
--- Futexes are currently supported on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD. On other
--- platforms this method calls sched_yield() and will either (1) return
--- unix.EINTR if a deadline is specified, otherwise (2) 0 is returned.
--- This means futexes will *work* on Windows, Mac, and NetBSD but they
--- won't be scalable in terms of CPU usage when many processes wait on
--- one process that holds a lock for a long time. In the future we may
--- polyfill futexes in userspace for these platforms to improve things
--- for folks who've adopted this api. If lock scalability is something
--- you need on Windows and MacOS today, then consider fcntl() which is
--- well-supported on all supported platforms but requires using files.
--- Please test your use case though, because it's kind of an edge case
--- to have the scenario above, and chances are this op will work fine.
